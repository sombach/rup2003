<h1><a name="whats-new">What's New in This Release </a></h1>
<p>The following enhancements and new features appear in this release: </p>
<ul>
  <li>The tree browser has been upgraded for enhanced capabilities of creating 
    customized <i>My RUP</i> trees.</li>
  <li>New look and feel of the entire RUP site.</li>
  <li>Replaced the Search Engine with a new and improved one.</li>
  <li>Extended Help has been upgraded and uses the same browser window as RUP.</li>
  <li>RUP will be delivered with Rational XDE in this release.</li>
  <li>RUP delivered in Rational Suites and as a point product with these 
  improvements to RUP Builder:</li>
  <ul>
    <li>Fine-grained selection of configurations by selecting the applicable 
    plug-ins, then selecting the applicable set of components within those 
    plug-ins.</li>
    <li>Includes a Process View Editor where project managers can specify, after 
    publishing, how the navigation tree will look. Project managers can create 
    multiple tabs on the navigation tree to express different views; for 
    example, a testing view, a development view, and an analysis view.</li>
    <li>RUP Builder is now UNIX compatible. </li>
  </ul>
  <li>Extended Help is delivered with the standard RUP browser as a tab on the 
  navigation tree. If Extended Help is started from a tool, it opens the RUP 
  with the Extended Help tab in focus.</li>
  <li>MyRUP lets you create tabs to unclutter the navigation tree. You can add 
  new nodes, which can be URLs, files, or any file type, allowing for a truly 
  customized navigation tree.</li>
  <li>Added new tool mentors:
  <ul>
    <li>Tool Mentor: Adding Elements to Source Control Using Rational ClearCase</li>
  </ul>
  </li>
</ul>

<p>We <u>strongly</u> recommend using the RUP with the most currently available 
version of your web browser. RUP requires Microsoft Internet Explorer 4.0 with 
SP1 or later. Some older versions of browsers do not allow the full capabilities 
of the RUP to be exercised.</p>

    <h3> Operating System Support for Java Runtime Environment (JRE)</h3>
  </li>
  <p>Due to the many JRE plugin versions available for each operating system, 
    the following are the versions that we have tested for tech supported operating 
    system. There are versions that we recommend you use. You may encounter problems 
    with other JRE plugin versions depending on your operating system.</p>
  <center>

  <p>&nbsp;</p>
  <li> 
    <h3> Installation of JRE Runtime Environment</h3>
  </li>
  <p>The RUP application is generally installed to systems by someone who has 
    administrator privileges. A common &quot;User&quot; is usually not allowed 
    to install any applications. If the administrator has forgotten to install 
    the correct JRE 1.4.1 plug-in required by the RUP Browser, someone logged 
    in as &quot;User&quot; or other than &quot;Administrator&quot; will observe 
    that the RUP Browser will be hanging during launch without a notification. 
    If this occurs, notify the system administrator to install the required version 
    of the JRE plug-in.</p>
  <br>
  <li> 
    <h3><a name="UNIX">UNIX platforms</a></h3>
  </li>
  <p>When launching the RUP Netscape Navigator on UNIX, a warning dialog may appear:</p>
  <blockquote> 
    <p><font size="2" face="Courier New">Netscape: subprocess diagnostics (stdout/stederr)</font></p>
    <blockquote> <font size="2" face="Courier New"> 
      <p>Warning: Name: HorScrollBar Class: XmScrollBar The scrollbar page increment 
        is less than 1</p>
      </font> </blockquote>
  </blockquote>
  <font size="3"> 
  <p>This occurs whenever the horizontal scrollbar must be displayed; that is, 
    it may not occur if your initial window is large enough that the left panel 
    doesn't need a scrollbar.</p>
  <p>You may disable dialogs for warning and error messages, and redirect messages 
    to a file using the following command:</p>
  </font> 
  <blockquote> 
    <p><font size="2" face="Courier New">netscape &#150;xrm &#145;*useStderrDialog: 
      False&#146; &#150;xrm &#145;*useStdoutDialog: False&#146; &gt;&amp;/tmp/log.$USER.ns</font></p>
  </blockquote>
  <ol type="i">
    <li><b>Long startup times on UNIX</b> 
      <blockquote> 
        <p>It can take more than one minute to start the RUP online on UNIX. Also 
          the search engine can take up to one minute to start. This is due to 
          the slow start up of the Java virtual machine.</p>
      </blockquote>
    </li>
    <li><b>Font Settings using Netscape 4.7x</b> 
      <blockquote> 
        <p>For users of Netscape 4.7x, if the default fonts are too small, the 
          following changes to your preferences should solve the problem: 
        <ul>
          <li>Go to Edit&gt;Preferences&gt;Fonts</li>
          <li>Select &quot;Use my default fonts, overriding document specified 
            fonts&quot;</li>
          <li>Set the default variable width font to Helvetica 12.</li>
          <li>Set the default fixed width font to Courier 12.</li>
        </ul>
      </blockquote>
      <br>
    <li><b> Enabling JRE Plug-in for Netscape 4.7x on Solaris</b> 
      <blockquote> 
        <p>To enable the Sun JRE plug-in for your Netscape 4.7x browser, if it 
          is not already enabled, you can set the NPX_PLUGIN_PATH environment 
          variable. This environment variable must point to the installed Sun 
          JRE plug-in location containing the javaplugin.so file. 
        <p>For example, on SPARC processor platforms, the default location of 
          javaplugin.so for the package installation is in /usr/j2se/jre/plugin/sparc/ns4. 
          You can then set the variable by using the command: 
        <blockquote> 
          <p>setenv NPX_PLUGIN_PATH /usr/j2se/jre/plugin/sparc/ns4</p>
        </blockquote>
        <p>Use the absolute path. 
        <p>Furthermore, you may need to restart your Netscape 4.7x browser twice 
          for the plug-in to be picked up. To check whether the plug-in is enabled, 
          do Help -&gt; About Plug-ins to confirm that the plug-in is loaded. 
      </blockquote>
      <br>
    <li><font size="3"><b>HP-UX 11.x</b> </font></li>
    <blockquote> 
      <p>If you will get an error stating that there is an "out of memory" problem 
        while publishing using RUP Builder, you can change certain kernal parameters 
        to resolve this problem. The underlying cause is that for most Java applications, 
        the kernel parameters, specifically, max_thred_proc, is by default, set 
        at too low a value. As a result, there are not enough kernel threads to 
        support the Java application and this manifests as an "out of memory" 
        error.</p>
      <p>More information can be found at: <a target="_blank" href="http://www.hp.com/products1/unix/java/infolibrary/prog_guide/java1_3/configuration.html"> 
        http://www.hp.com/products1/unix/java/infolibrary/prog_guide/java1_3/configuration.html</a></p>
      <p>Furthermore, the tools used to determine the current parameter values 
        (HPjconfig) and to modify them (Jave out-of-box tool) can be found from 
        HP.com website.</P>
      <p>In testing, these are the tuned parameters that we have found to fix 
        the problem:</P>

        <h4>Browser Window too Small</h4>
        <p>When using Windows 2000 or Windows 98, if the Internet Explorer browser 
          window is too small to display the tree browser, the RUP will not be 
          displayed properly. You will need to increase the browser window size 
          and refresh.</p>

        <h4>Printing Error</h4>
        <p>When the cursor is in the tree browser frame, if one tries to print 
          the content in the main frame by selecting File &gt; Print. The product 
          splash screen will be displayed in the main frame under you click on 
          another node in the tree browser. The output of the print job will be 
          blank.Use the Print icon located on the banner instead.

      <h4>The Java Applets Do Not Run with version 3.x of Netscape and Microsoft 
        browsers</h4>
      <p>Using Internet Explorer 3.x and Netscape 3.x, you cannot run the Java 
        applets, such as the tree browser in the left frame. When you start the 
        RUP, using IE 3.x, a new window will be displayed that</p>
      <blockquote> 
        <p>a) Directs you to the Microsoft or Netscape home pages to download 
          the latest version of the browser.</p>
      </blockquote>
      <blockquote> 
        <p>b) Gives you the option to use the Site Map to browse the Unified Process 
          using version 3.x of the browser.</p>
      </blockquote>
    </li>
    <li> 
      <h4>The Java Applets do not run with browsers which do not support Java 
        applets (IE 2.x and Netscape 2.x)</h4>
      <p>The RUP uses Java applets to provide search, index and navigation capabilities; 
        use of browsers that do not support Java applets is not supported. See 
        browser compatibility note above.</p>
      <p>Browsing the Unified Process using non-Java compliant browsers can be 
        accomplished with a loss of functionality using the web page ./sitemap/sitemap.htm 
        under the Unified process install directory.</p>
    </li>
    <li> 
      <h4>Disk Space Usage</h4>
      <p>29 MB (Windows NT). Run the DOS command chkdsk for information on your 
        file system.</p>
      <p>UNIX 30 MB</p>
    </li>
    <li> 
      <h4>Crude Formatting using Netscape Navigator 3.x and Microsoft Internet 
        Explorer 3.x</h4>
      <p>Navigator 3.x and IE 3.x do not support cascading style sheets (CSS), 
        which are used by the RUP. This means that the formatting and layout is 
        crude on Navigator 3.x and IE 3.x. We strongly recommend upgrading to 
        a newer release of your browser.</p>
    </li>
    <li> 
      <h4>Small fonts</h4>
      <p>If you find the text font to be too small you can change the web-browsers 
        default font. This will make the text on all pages to be displayed with 
        a larger font.</p>
    </li>
    <li> 
      <h4>JRE plugin requirements </h4>
      <p>JRE1.4.1 plugin must be used for both IE and Netscape. Windows users 
        who have installed RUP from the CD can install the JRE plug-in by running 
        j2re-1_4_1-windwos-i586-i.exe from common\rwp\JRE_plugins folder where 
        RUP is installed. Other RUP users need to get it from the JAVA SUN site 
        http://java.sun.com/products/archive/j2se/1.4.1/index.html. UNIX users 
        need to check on the website for their particular machine (i.e. HP or 
        SUN).<br>
      </p>
    </li>
    <li> 
      <h4>JRE plugin requirements on non-English Operating Systems </h4>
      <p>The internationalized version of the JRE plugin must be installed for 
        operating systems with a double-byte character set, for example, Japanese 
        or Chinese. The internationalized version of the JRE can be found from 
        <a target="_blank" href="http://java.sun.com/products/archive/j2se/1.3.1_02/jre/index.html"> 
        http://java.sun.com/products/archive/j2se/1.4.1/index.html</a></p>
    </li>
    <li> 
      <h4>Java Console present while browsing RUP</h4>
      <p>When RUP is started, the Java console starts up and will shut down when 
        RUP is closed.</p>
    </li>
    <li> 
      <h4>ATI Radeon Cards</h4>
      <p>If your system has an ATI Radeon video card, you might experience undesired 
        behavior. To find out whether your system has this type of video card, 
        right-mouse click on your desktop -> Settings -> Advanced -> Adapter. 
        There is an existing problem with the JRE used to run RUP and the driver 
        for the ATI Radeon cards, which will intermittently, cause your system 
        to freeze when you run or shutdown RUP. ATI has release a new driver which 
        seems to fix the problem. The driver is available from Windows Update. 
        Go to Drivers Update -> ATI Technologies Video card. You can also put 
        the line &quot;-Dsun.java2d.d3d=false -Dsun.java2d.noddraw=true&quot; 
        in the parameter string for your plug-in. Go to Control Panel, Java Plug-in, 
        Advanced Tab. Put the above line into text box for Java Runtime parameters.</p>

      <h4>Full Path required in Publish Location</h4><blockquote>
      <p>In RUP Builder, when you do not put the full path to the folder that 
        you want to publish to, the folder will automatically be<br>
        put in the RUP Builder installed directory. When publishing is completed, 
        and you are prompted to view the website, an error may occur as a result 
        of the web browser not being given the full path to the folder location 
        in the installed directory.</p>
      <p>Normally, as a user, you should put in the full path to the folder where 
        you want to publish, such as &quot;C:\Program Files\MyPublishedFolder&quot; 
        or &quot;\\MyUNCServerLocation\MyPublishedFolder&quot;. </p></blockquote>
