<p><a name="XE_artifacts__introduction">Activities</a> have input and output artifacts. 
  An <b>artifact</b> is a work product of the process: roles use artifacts to 
  perform activities, and produce artifacts in the course of performing activities. 
  Artifacts are the responsibility of a single role, making responsibility easy 
  to identify and understand, and promoting the idea that every piece of information 
  produced in the process requires the appropriate set of skills. Even though 
  one role may &quot;own&quot; the artifact, other roles will use the artifact, 
  perhaps even updating it if the role has been given permission to do so.</p>

<p align="center" class="picturetext">Major artifacts in the process, and the 
  approximate flow of information between them.</p>

<p>The diagram above shows how information flows through the project, using the 
  artifacts; the arrows show how changes in one artifact ripple through other 
  artifacts along the arrows. For clarity, many artifacts are omitted; for example, 
  the many artifacts in the design model are omitted, being represented by the 
  Artifact: Design Model.</p>

<p>To simplify the organization of artifacts, they are organized into &quot;information 
  sets&quot;, or <b>artifact sets</b>. An artifact set is a grouping of related 
  artifacts that tend to be used for a similar purpose. An artifact may be composed 
  of other artifacts. The <a href="../../process/artifact/ovu_arts.htm">Artifact 
  Overview</a> presents more information on artifacts and artifact sets.</p>

<p align="center"><img border="0" src="images/ar_tree.gif" width="236" height="176"></p>

<p align="center" class="picturetext">Artifacts and artifact sets in the treebrowser</p>

<p>Artifacts may take various shapes or forms, such as:</p>

<ul>
  <li>A <b>model</b>, such as the <a href="../../process/artifact/ar_ucmod.htm">Use-Case 
    Model</a> or the <a href="../../process/artifact/ar_desmd.htm">Design Model</a>, 
    which contains other artifacts.</li>
  <li>A <b>model element</b>; that is, an element within a model, such as a <a href="../../process/artifact/ar_class.htm">Design 
    Class</a>, a <a href="../../process/artifact/ar_uc.htm">Use Case</a> or a 
    <a href="../../process/artifact/ar_dsub.htm">Design Subsystem</a></li>
  <li><b>Databases</b> or other types of tabular information repositories such 
    as spreadsheets</li>
  <li>Source code and executables (kinds of <a href="../../process/artifact/ar_comp.htm">Implementation 
    Elements</a>)</li>
  <li>Various types of documents, for example a <b>specification document, </b>such 
    as <a href="../../process/artifact/ar_srs.htm">Requirements Specification</a>, 
    or a <b>plan document</b>, such as the <a href="../../process/artifact/ar_sdp.htm">Software 
    Development Plan</a>. </li>
</ul>

<p>Note that &quot;<b>artifact</b>&quot; is the term used in the RUP to describe 
  what other processes denote using terms such as <b>work product</b>, <b>work 
  unit</b>, and so on. In RUP, <b>deliverables</b> are only considered to be the 
  subset of all artifacts that will end up being delivered into the hands of the 
  customers and end-users, usually as part of a formal or contractually agreed 
  hand-over.</p>

<p>In RUP, <b>artifacts are generally <i>not</i> documents</b>. Many processes 
  have an excessive focus on documents, and in particular on <i>paper documentation</i>. 
  The RUP discourages the systematic production of paper documents. The most efficient 
  and pragmatic approach to managing project artifacts is to maintain the artifacts 
  <i>within</i> the appropriate tool used to create and manage them. When necessary, 
  you may generate documents (snapshots) from these tools, on a just-in-time basis. 
  You should also consider delivering artifacts to the interested parties inside 
  and together with the tool, rather than on paper. This approach ensures that 
  the information is always up-to-date and based on actual project work, and it 
  should not require any additional effort to produce.</p>

<p>Examples of artifacts:</p>
<ul>
  <li>A design model stored in Rational Rose.</li>
  <li>A project plan stored in Microsoft&#174; Project&#174;.</li>
  <li>A defect stored in Rational ClearQuest.</li>
  <li>A project requirements database in Rational RequisitePro.</li>
</ul>

<p>Note also that formats such as on <b>whiteboards</b> or <b>flipcharts</b> can 
  be used to capture pictorial information such as UML diagrams, tabular information 
  such as short lists of status information or even textual information such as 
  short vision statements. These formats work well for smaller, Collocated teams 
  where all team members have ready access to these resources.</p>
<p>However, there are still artifacts which either have to be or are best suited 
  to being plain text documents, as in the case of external input to the project, 
  or in some cases where it is simply the best means of presenting descriptive 
  information. Where possible, you should consider using collaborative <b>Work 
  Group</b> tools, such as Rational RequisitePro, Lotus Notes, WikiWiki webs or 
  Groove to capture textual documentation electronically, simplifying ongoing 
  content and version management.</p>
<p>This is especially of importance where historic records must be maintained 
  for purposes such as fulfilling audit requirements. For any nontrivial development 
  effort, especially where large development teams are involved, <b>Artifacts 
  are most likely to be subject to version control and configuration management.</b> 
  This is sometimes only achieved by versioning the container artifact, when it 
  is not possible to do it for the elementary, contained artifacts. For example, 
  you may control the versions of a whole design model, or design package, and 
  not the individual classes they contain.</p>

<h4><a name="Artifact Guidelines">Artifact Guidelines and Checkpoints</a> <a target="_self" href="#Top"><img src="../../images/top.gif" border="0" width="26" height="20"></a></h4>
<p>Artifacts typically have associated guidelines and checkpoints which present 
  information on how to develop, evaluate and use the artifacts. Some artifacts 
  have concept pages associated with them, although these are more descriptive 
  in nature, and often associated with more high-level process elements, such 
  as disciplines. Much of the substance of the Process is contained in the artifact 
  guidelines; the activity descriptions try to capture the essence of what is 
  done, while the artifact guidelines capture the essence of doing the work. The 
  checkpoints provide a quick reference to help you assess the quality of the 
  artifact. Concepts provide an educational or informative view of the artifact.</p>
<p>Both guidelines, checkpoints, and concepts, are useful in a number of contexts: 
  they help you decide what to do, they help you to do it, they help you to decide 
  if you've done a good job when you're done, and they help you understand how 
  this artifact relates to the rest of the process. Supporting content pages related 
  to each specific artifact are organized along with that artifact in the treebrowser.

<h4><b><a name="Templates">Template</a> </b><a target="_self" href="#Top"><img src="../../images/top.gif" border="0" width="26" height="20"></a></h4>

<p><a name="XE_templates__introduction">Templates</a> are &quot;models,&quot; 
  or prototypes, of artifacts. Associated with the artifact description are one 
  or more templates that can be used to create the corresponding artifacts. Templates 
  are linked to the tool that is to be used.</p>

<p>For example:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Microsoft&#174; Word&#174; templates would be used for artifacts that are 
    documents, and for some reports.</li>
  <li>Rational SoDA templates for Microsoft Word or Adobe&#174; FrameMaker&#174; would extract 
    information from tools such as Rational Rose, Rational RequisitePro, or Rational 
    TeamTest.</li>
  <li>Microsoft&#174; FrontPage&#174; templates for the various elements of the process.</li>
  <li>Microsoft Project template for the project plan.</li>
</ul>

<p>As with guidelines, organizations may want to customize the templates prior 
  to using them by adding the company logo, some project identification, or information 
  specific to the type of project. Templates are listed in the Templates &amp; 
  Reports section of an artifact page and they are organized in the treebrowser 
  beneath their associated artifact. They are also summarized in the <a href="../../process/templates.htm">Templates</a> 
  overview page, and a separate treebrowser entry shows <b>all</b> templates in 
  your RUP configuration.</p>

<p align="center"><img border="0" src="images/tmpl_tree.gif" width="338" height="162"></p>
<p align="center" class="picturetext">Expanded portion of the treebrowser, showing 
  the different kinds of templates in the RUP.</p>

<h4><a name="Example"></a>Example <a target="_self" href="#Top"><img src="../../images/top.gif" border="0" width="26" height="20"></a></h4>
<p>An example of an artifact is a good supplement to its prescriptive and descriptive 
  process guidance. Examples are associated with the specific artifacts in the 
  RUP Website to give the producer of this artifact a view of how it can look 
  like when its done. The examples of an artifact are listed in the Examples section 
  of the artifact description, and are generally organized in the treebrowser 
  beneath the artifact on which they exemplify. An overview of all examples in 
  your RUP configuration is presented in the <a href="../../examples/ovu_arex.htm">Examples</a> 
  overview page, and a separate treebrowser entry shows any complete project examples 
  included.</p>
  
<p align="center"><img border="0" src="images/ex_tree.gif" width="331" height="127"></p>
<p align="center" class="picturetext">The Examples entry in the Overview section 
  of the treebrowser provides access to artifact examples in the RUP.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h4><a name="Reports">Report</a> <a target="_self" href="#Top"><img src="../../images/top.gif" border="0" width="26" height="20"></a></h4>

<p><a name="XE_reports__introduction">Artifact</a>s may have reports associated 
  with them. A report extracts information about one or more artifacts from a 
  tool. For example, a report can present an artifact or a set of artifacts for 
  use in a technical review. Unlike regular artifacts, reports are not subject 
  to version control, however they may be baselined to provide a historic audit 
  trail of the report over time. In some cases, the development tools enable the 
  report to be reproduced at any time by rerunning the report against the historic 
  artifacts. Reports are listed in the Templates &amp; Reports section of an artifact 
  page, and are generally organized in the treebrowser beneath the artifact on 
  which they report.</p>
