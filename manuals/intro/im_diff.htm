<h4>General Changes</h4>
<ul>
  <li><b>Improved User-Configuration of the Process with RUP Builder</b> 
    <ul>
      <li>The process has been refactored across all disciplines to create more 
        than 60 selectable components, with improved ability to mix and match 
        both plug-ins and components.</li>
      <li>Small, medium, and large project configuration templates provide a starting 
        point for process configuration.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <ul>
    <li>Formal and Informal Resources plug-ins allows flexibility in &quot;level 
      of ceremony&quot;.</li>
    <li>Contextual views into RUP are provided, such as the &quot;developer&quot; 
      role view, and &quot;getting started&quot; view.</li>
    <li>Improved generation of graphics and tables that reflect the selected process 
      configuration.</li>
  </ul>
  <li><b>MyRUP Personalization</b> 
    <ul>
      <li>Each RUP user can create his/her own personalized view into RUP.</li>
      <li>Users can add links to external and internal resources.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li><b>Tool Integration</b> 
    <ul>
      <li>New and Updated Tool Mentors: 
        <ul>
          <li> New tool mentors for Rational XDE, RUP Builder, and Rational Process 
            Workbench. </li>
          <li>New tool mentors for using the RUP Web site, including searching, 
            extended help and navigation.</li>
        </ul>
      </li>
      <li>Extended Help launches a view in RUP.</li>
      <li>Search engine provides seamless search across RUP and RDN, and other 
        new options.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li><b>Content</b> 
    <ul>
      <li>Guidelines, concepts, white papers, and checklists can now be attached 
        to any process element, and so are now associated to the process elements 
        where they are most relevant. The separate concept of a &quot;Work Guideline&quot; 
        is gone.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li><b>Look and Feel</b> 
    <ul>
      <li>The Web site's navigation and layout has been upgraded to align with 
        other Rational Web products.</li>

<h4>Specific Changes and Additions to Content</h4>
<ul>
  <li><b>Overview</b> 
    <ul>
      <li><a name="XE_getting_started__disabling_the_process_view"></a><a name="XE_disabling_the_getting_started_process_view"></a>New 
        &quot;Getting Started&quot; page provides answers to commonly asked questions 
        for those new to RUP, and is presented along with relevant content as 
        part of a specific process view in the tree browser.<br>
        <b>Note</b>: The &quot;Getting Started&quot; view can be disabled by either 
        a) for the entire project team, republishing the RUP Web site from RUP 
        Builder and excluding the &quot;Getting Started&quot; process view or 
        b) for the individual practitioner, using the &quot;Tree Sets&quot; feature 
        of the tree browser to display a single process view of your choice.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li><b>RUP Lifecycle</b></li>
  <ul>
    <li>Example Iteration Workflows provide a phase-based and time-based view 
      into the process.</li>
  </ul>
  <li><b>Disciplines</b> 
    <ul>
      <li>Concepts pages are no longer all grouped under each discipline, but 
        are now attached to the most relevant process element. Only those concepts 
        and guidelines needed to understand the discipline as a whole are directly 
        attached to the discipline.</li>
      <li> All technical reviewer roles, such as Business Model reviewer and Design 
        Reviewer, have been replaced by a single Technical Reviewer role, which 
        now performs all technical review activities across the disciplines.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li><b>Business Modeling Discipline</b></li>
  <ul>
    <li>New support for modeling business rules, goals, and events. </li>

      Model.</li>
  </ul>
  <li><b>Requirements Discipline</b> 
    <ul>
      <li>A generic &quot;Software Requirement&quot; has been added in support 
        of more flexible process configuration by the project team.</li>
      <li>The guidance on storyboarding has been generalized by removing the dependency 
        on use cases.<br>
        (See Artifact: Storyboard).</li>
      <li>User Interface Design has been moved to the Analysis and Design Discipline.</li>
      <li>Artifact: User-Experience Storyboard has been added to the separate 
        User Experience Plug-In to address user-experience design concerns.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li><b>Analysis and Design Discipline</b> 
    <ul>
      <li>Data Modeling content has been upgraded to cover conceptual, logical, 
        and physical database modeling.</li>

        and upgraded to reflect industry practices, including the new artifact 
        Navigation Map.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li><b> Implementation Discipline</b></li>
  <ul>
    <li>Artifact: Component has been replaced with Artifact: Implementation Element.</li>

      <li>New Test Strategy artifact.<br>
      </li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li><b>Environment Discipline</b></li>
  <ul>
    <li>Guidance on defining the organizational process environment has been broken 
      out into a separate process packaged with RPW , leaving the RUP to focus 
      on Project Environment only. <br>
    </li>
    <li>Improved guidance for implementing a process for a project, supported 
      by the RUP tooling for customization and configuration of process.</li>
    <li>New Artifact : Development Process and Activity: Tailor the process for 
      the project, to describe the project-specific process. <br>
    </li>
    <li>All &quot;Guidelines&quot; type artifacts, such as &quot;Design Guidelines&quot; 
      and &quot;Business Modeling Guidelines&quot;, have been replaced by a single 
      more generic artifact, &quot;Project-Specific Guidelines&quot;.</li>
  </ul>
  <li><b>Project Management Discipline</b></li>
  <ul>
    <li>New Reviewer and Review Coordinator roles were added to better describe 
      the review process.</li>

<ul>
  <li><b>Business Modeling Workflow</b>
  <ul>
    <li>Four new concepts pages have been added to clarify the role of business 
    modeling in the context of e-business development.</li>
    <li>The page Concepts: Activity Based Costing outlines how the technique can 
    be applied within the RUP.</li>
    <li>The page Concepts: Business Architecture explains our definition of what 
    it means to architect a business.</li>
    <li>The page Concepts: Business Patterns gives some examples of useful 
    patterns to apply in business modeling.</li>
    <li>The page Concepts: e-business Development gives our definition of the

    <li>Three new workflow details have been added to the workflow diagram: 
    &quot;assess business status&quot;, &quot;describe current business&quot;, and &quot;explore process 
    automation&quot;.</li>
    <li>Workflow detail: Assess Business Status describes how you assess the 
    status of the organization in which the eventual system is to be deployed 
    (the target organization).</li>
    <li>Workflow detail: Describe Current Business talks about how you work to 
    describe the current organization's processes and structure in order to 
    better understand needs for improvement.</li>
    <li>Workflow detail: Explore Process Automation talks about how you 
    determine what can and should be automated of the business processes, how 
    you understand how any existing systems (legacy) should fit into the 
    organization, and how you derive system requirements from your business 
    models.</li>
    <li>Five new artifacts have been added: &quot;target-organization assessment&quot;, 
    &quot;business vision&quot;, &quot;business glossary&quot;, &quot;business rules&quot;, and &quot;business 
    architecture document&quot;.</li>
    <li>Artifact: Target-Organization Assessment describes the current status of 
    the organization in which the system is to be deployed. The description is 
    in terms of current processes, tools, peoples' competencies, peoples'

<h2><a name="5.5">From the Rational Unified Process 5.1.1 to 5.5</a>
<a href="#Top">
<img src="../../images/top.gif" alt="Top" border="0" width="26" height="20"></a></h2>
<p>Release 5.5 is the successor to release 5.1.1. It adds or changes content in 
the following topic areas: </p>
<ul>
  <li>Improved 'Getting Started' content, including automatic display of getting 
  started topics on product start-up. The automatic start-up may be disabled at 
  the user's discretion. This feature includes and subsumes the 'Guided Tour' 
  concept which appeared in version 5.0. The 'old' Guided Tour is now expanded 
  under the 'Process Roles' link on the 'Getting Started' window.</li>
  <li>Simplification of the treebrowser.</li>
  <li>Improved process Overview.</li>
  <li>Re-designed core workflows, now using Workflow Detail Overviews to express 
  workflows. The workflows are expressed as activity diagrams using workflow 
  details to provide an easier to understand picture of how the work on the 
  project is done.</li>
  <li>Expanded 'Workflow Details'; these have now become the focal point for the 
  expression of workflows in the process.</li>
  <li>Improved process configuration and implementation content in the '<b>Environment 
  Workflow</b>'.</li>
  <li>Improved cross-referencing, to improve product usability. Especially 
  noteworthy are the links between Artifacts and Activities (see Artifact: 
  Software Architecture Document for an example).</li>
  <li>Expanded '<b>Project Management Workflow</b>' content, including metrics 
  and estimation, project planning and project control.</li>
  <li>Removal of Rational SoDA and Rational Rose model templates from the RUP. 
  These templates are now provided with their respective Rational Software 
  products and are automatically installed when those products are installed. 
  Use of these template is still described in appropriate RUP Tool Mentors.</li>
  <li>Java Programming Guidelines have been added.</li>
  <li>Added the concept of Roadmaps, which describes how the process can be 
  tailored to a particular style or type of software development. There are two 
  Roadmaps in this release: one for component-based development, and one 
  expressing how a focus on quality manifests itself throughout the lifecycle. 
  We expect more to be included in future releases.</li>
  <li>Two new white papers: one covering strategies for traceability, and 
  another describing modeling Web applications with UML.</li>
  <li>Added Change Request Management process information in Configuration and 
  Change Management workflow.</li>
  <li>Updated Vision template to include more and proper emphasis on 
  stakeholders/user and needs/requests.</li>
  <li>New artifacts:
  <ul>
    <li>Software Requirements Specification in the Requirements workflow; 
    templates are included for use both with and without use-case modeling.</li>
    <li>Requirements Management Plan for setting up project requirement 
    artifacts.</li>
  </ul>
  </li>
  <li>Updated document templates to include consistent formats styles, and 
  informational guidance.</li>
  <li>FrameMaker templates now available from the RUP Resource Center.</li>
  <li><b>Expanded links and cross-references:</b>
  <ul>
    <li>between artifacts and the activities that use, produce or modify them</li>
    <li>between activities and the workflow details that organize them.</li>
  </ul>
  </li>
</ul>
