<p>It's important that the quality of all artifacts are assessed at several
points in the project's lifecycle as they mature. Artifacts should be evaluated as the
activities that produce them complete and at the conclusion of each iteration.
In particular, as executable software is produced, it should be subjected to
demonstration and test of important scenarios in each iteration, which provides a
more tangible understanding of design trade-offs and earlier elimination of
architectural defects. This is in contrast to a more traditional approach that leaves the testing of integrated software until late in the
project's lifecycle.</p>

<h3><a name="Introduction">Introduction</a> <a href="#Top"><img src="../../images/top.gif" alt="To top of page" border="0" width="26" height="20"></a></h3>
<p>Quality is something we all strive for in our products, processes, and
services. Yet when asked, &quot;What is Quality?&quot;, everyone has a different
opinion. Common responses include one or the other of these:</p>
<ul>
  <li>&quot;Quality ... I'm not sure how to describe it, but I'll
    know it when I see it.&quot;</li>
  <li>&quot;... meeting requirements.&quot;</li>
</ul>

<p>Perhaps the most frequent reference to quality, specifically related to
software, is this
remark regarding its absence:</p>
<blockquote>

<p>&quot;How could they release something like this with such
    low quality!?&quot;</p>
</blockquote>

<p>These commonplace responses are telling, but they offer little room to
rigorously examine quality and improve upon its execution. These comments all
illustrate the need to define quality in a manner in which it can be measured
and achieved.</p>
<p>Quality, however, is not a singular characteristic or attribute. It's
multi-dimensional and can be possessed by a product or a process.
Product quality is concentrated on building the right product, whereas process
quality is focused on building the product correctly. See <a href="../../process/workflow/test/co_rqlty.htm">Concepts:
Product Quality</a> and <a href="../../process/workflow/environm/co_sqlty.htm">Concepts:
Process Quality</a> for additional information.</p>
<h3><a name="Definition of Quality">Definition of Quality</a> <a href="#Top"><img src="../../images/top.gif" alt="To top of page" border="0" width="26" height="20"></a></h3>
<p>The definition of quality, taken from The American Heritage Dictionary of
the English Language, 3rd Edition, Houghton Mifflin Co.,&#169 1992, 1996, is:</p>
<blockquote>
<p><b>Quality</b>  (kwol'i-te) n., pl. <b>-ties</b>.
    Abbr. <b>qlty</b>. <b>1.a.</b> An inherent or
    distinguishing characteristic; a property. <b>b.</b> A personal
    trait, especially a character trait. <b>2.</b> Essential
    character; nature. <b>3.a.</b> Superiority of kind. <b>b.</b>
    Degree or grade of excellence.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>As demonstrated by this definition, quality is not a single dimension, but
many. To use the definition and apply it to software
development, the definition must be refined. Therefore, for the purposes of the Rational Unified
Process (RUP), quality is defined
as:</p>
<blockquote>

<p>&quot;...the characteristic of having demonstrated the achievement of
producing a product that meets or exceeds agreed-on requirements&#151as measured by
agreed-on measures and criteria&#151and that is produced by an agreed-on
process.&quot;</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Achieving quality is not simply &quot;meeting requirements&quot;,
or producing a product that meets user needs and expectations. Rather,
quality also includes identifying the measures and criteria to demonstrate the
achievement of quality, and the implementation of a process to ensure that the
product created by the process has achieved the desired degree of quality, and
can be repeated and managed.</p>
<p>See also the following pages for additional information on how the RUP defines the idea of quality:
<ul>

</ul>
<h3><a name="Who Owns Quality?">Who Owns Quality?</a> <a href="#Top"><img src="../../images/top.gif" alt="To top of page" border="0" width="26" height="20"></a></h3>
<p>A common misconception is that quality is owned by, or is the responsibility
of, one group. This myth is often perpetuated by creating a group, sometimes
called Quality Assurance&#151other names include Test, Quality Control, and Quality
Engineering&#151and giving them the charter and the responsibility for quality.</p>
<p>Quality is, and should be, the responsibility of everyone. Achieving quality
must be integral to almost all process activities, instead of a separate
discipline, thereby making everyone responsible for the quality of the products
(or artifacts) they produce and for the implementation of the process in which they
are involved.</p>
<p>Each role contributes to the achievement of quality in the following ways:
<ul>
  <li>Product quality&#151the contribution to the overall achievement of quality
    in each artifact being produced.</li>
  <li>Process quality&#151the achievement of quality in the process activities for
    which they are involved.</li>
</ul>
<p>Everyone shares in the responsibility and glory for achieving a
high-quality product, or in the shame of a low-quality product. But only those directly
involved in a specific process component are responsible for the glory, or
shame,
for the quality of those process components (and the artifacts). Someone,
however, must take the responsibility for managing quality; that is, providing
the supervision to ensure that quality is being managed, measured, and achieved.
The role responsible for managing quality is the <a href="../../process/workers/wk_projm.htm">Project
Manager</a>.</p>
<h3><a name="Common Misconceptions about Quality">Common Misconceptions about 
  Quality</a> <a href="#Top"><img src="../../images/top.gif" alt="To top of page" border="0" width="26" height="20"></a></h3>
<p>There are many misconceptions regarding quality and the most common include:
<ul>
  <li><a href="#Quality can be added to, or tested into a product:">Quality can
    be added to or &quot;tested&quot; into a product</a></li>
  <li><a href="#Quality is a single dimension, attribute, or characteristic and means the same thing to everyone">Quality
    is a single dimension, attribute, or characteristic and means the
    same thing to everyone</a></li>
  <li><a href="#Quality happens on its own:">Quality happens on its own</a></li>
</ul>
<h4><a name="Quality can be added to, or tested into a product:">Quality can be
added to or &quot;tested&quot; into a product</a></h4>
<p>Just as a product cannot be produced if there is no description of what it
is, what it needs to do, who uses it and how it's used, and so on, quality and its
achievement
cannot be attained if it's not described, measured, and part of the process of
creating the product.</p>
<p>See <a href="../../process/workflow/manageme/co_meqlty.htm">Concepts:
Measuring Quality</a> and the section of this document titled <a href="#Quality happens on its own:">Quality
happens on its own</a>.</p>
<h4><a name="Quality is a single dimension, attribute, or characteristic and means the same thing to everyone">Quality
is a single dimension, attribute, or characteristic and means the same
thing to everyone</a></h4>
<p>Quality is not a single dimension, attribute, or characteristic. Quality is
measured in many ways&#151quality metrics and criteria are established to meet the
needs of project, organization, and customer.</p>
<p>Quality can be measured along several dimensions&#151some apply to process
quality; some to product quality; some to both. Quality can be measured for:
<ul>
  <li>Progress&#151such as use cases demonstrated or milestones completed</li>
  <li>Variance&#151differences between planned and actual schedules, budgets,
    staffing requirements, and so forth</li>
  <li>Reliability&#151resistance to failure (crashing, hanging, memory leaks,
    and so on) during execution</li>
  <li>Function&#151the artifact implements and executes the required use cases as
    intended</li>
  <li>Performance&#151the artifact executes and responds in a timely and
    acceptable manner, and continues to perform acceptably when subjected to
    real-world operational characteristics such as load, stress, and lengthy
    periods of operation</li>
</ul>
<p>See <a href="../../process/workflow/test/co_qtydm.htm">Concepts: Quality
Dimensions</a>, <a href="../../process/workflow/test/co_rqlty.htm">Concepts:

Process Quality</a> for additional information.</p>
<h4><a name="Quality happens on its own:">Quality happens on its own</a></h4>
<p>Quality cannot happen by itself. For quality to be achieved, a process is
must be implemented, adhered to, and measured. The purpose of the RUP is to provide a disciplined approach to assigning tasks and
responsibilities within a development organization. Our goal is to ensure the
production of high-quality software that meets the needs of our end users,
within a predictable schedule and budget. The RUP captures
many of the best practices in modern software development in a form that can be
tailored for a wide range of projects and organizations. The <a href="../../process/workflow/ovu_env.htm">Environment</a>
discipline gives you guidance about how to best configure the process to your needs.</p>
<p>Processes can be configured and quality&#151criteria for acceptability&#151can be
negotiated, based upon several factors. The most common factors are:
<ul>
  <li>Risk (including liability)</li>
  <li>Market opportunities</li>
  <li>Revenue requirements</li>
  <li>Staffing or scheduling issues</li>
  <li>Budgets</li>
</ul>
<p>Changes in the process and criteria for acceptability should be identified
and agreed upon at the outset of the project.</p>
<h3><a name="Management of Quality in the Rational Unified Process">Management 
  of Quality in the RUP</a> <a href="#Top"><img src="../../images/top.gif" alt="To top of page" border="0" width="26" height="20"></a></h3>
<p>Managing quality is done for these purposes:
<ul>
  <li>To identify appropriate indicators (metrics) of acceptable quality</li>
  <li>To identify appropriate measures to be used in evaluating and assessing
    quality</li>
  <li>To identify and appropriately address issues affecting quality as early
    and effectively as possible</li>
</ul>
<p>Managing quality is implemented throughout all disciplines, workflows, phases, and
iterations in the RUP. In general, managing quality
throughout the lifecycle means you implement, measure, and assess both process
quality and product quality. Some of the efforts expended to manage quality
in each discipline are highlighted in the following list:
<ul>
  <li>Managing quality in the <a href="../../process/workflow/ovu_req.htm"><b>Requirements</b></a>
    discipline includes analyzing the requirements artifact set for
    consistency (between artifact standards and other artifacts), clarity
    (clearly communicates information to all shareholders, stakeholders, and
    other roles), and precision (the appropriate level of detail and accuracy).</li>
  <li>In the <a href="../../process/workflow/ovu_and.htm"><b>Analysis &amp;
    Design</b></a><i>  </i>discipline, managing quality includes assessing
    the design artifact set, including the consistency of the design model, its
    translation from the requirements artifacts, and its translation into the
    implementation artifacts.</li>
  <li>In the <a href="../../process/workflow/ovu_impl.htm"><b>Implementation</b></a>
    discipline, managing quality includes assessing the implementation artifacts
    and evaluating the source code or executable artifacts against the
    appropriate requirements, design, and test artifacts.</li>
  <li>The <a href="../../process/workflow/ovu_test.htm"><b>Test</b></a><i>
    </i>discipline is highly focused toward managing quality, as most of
    the efforts expended in this discipline address the three purposes of managing
    quality, identified previously.</li>
  <li>The <a href="../../process/workflow/ovu_env.htm"><b>Environment</b></a><i>
    </i>discipline, like the Test discipline, includes many efforts addressing the purposes of
    managing quality. Here you can find guidance on how to best configure your
    process to meet your needs.</li>
  <li>Managing quality in 
    the <a href="../../process/workflow/ovu_dep.htm"><b>Deployment</b></a><i> 
    </i>discipline includes assessing the implementation 
    and deployment artifacts, and evaluating the executable and deployment artifacts 
    against the appropriate requirements, design, and test artifacts needed to 
    deliver the product to your customer.</li>
  <li>The <a href="../../process/workflow/ovu_mgm.htm"><b>Project
    Management</b></a><i>  </i>discipline includes an overview of many
    efforts for managing quality, including the reviews and audits required to assess the
    implementation, adherence, and progress of the development process.</li>
</ul>
