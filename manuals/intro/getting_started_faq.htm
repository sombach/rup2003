<h3><a name="What">What is the Rational Unified Process (RUP)?</a> <a href="#Top"><img src="../../images/top.gif" alt="Top" border="0" width="26" height="20"></a></h3>

<h4><a name="HeartOfRUP">The heart of RUP</a> <a href="#PlatformImage"><img src="../../images/top.gif" alt="Top" border="0" width="26" height="20"></a></h4>
<p>At it's heart, the Rational Unified Process&reg; (RUP&reg;) is about successful 
  software development. There are three central elements that define RUP:</p>
<ul>
  <li>
    <h5>An underlying set of philosophies and practices for successful software 
      development.</h5>
    <p>These philosophies, <a href="im_bp.htm">core practices</a> and <a href="im_esstl.htm">essential 
      elements</a> are the foundation on which the RUP has been developed. RUP 
      has a long history of ongoing evolution that has included the Rational Approach, 
      the Objectory Process, ClearGuide, SQA Process and so forth.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <h5>A process model and associated content library.</h5>
    <p>Defined and improved on an ongoing basis by Rational Software, the RUP 
      process model and associated content library defines the base RUP software 
      engineering process from which you create your own process configurations.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <h5>The underlying process definition language.</h5>
    <p>Underlying it all is a <a href="../../process/workflow/environm/co_morop.htm">process 
      meta-model</a>. This model provides a language of <a href="im_keymc.htm">process 
      definition elements</a> for describing a software engineering process. This 
      language is based on the SPEM extension to the UML for software process 
      engineering and the Unified Process methodology.</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<h4><a name="ProcessPlatform">The RUP process platform</a>
  <a href="#PlatformImage"><img src="../../images/top.gif" alt="Top" border="0" width="26" height="20"></a></h4>
<p>Over many years of development effort, the RUP has evolved into a rich family 
  of integrated software-engineering process products. These products enable software 
  development teams to define, configure, tailor and practice a common software-engineering 
  process. The key elements of the product family are:</p>
<ul>
  <li>
    <h5><a name="ProcessDeliveryTools">Process Delivery Tools</a>.
	  <a href="#PlatformImage"><img src="../../images/top.gif" alt="Top" border="0" width="26" height="20"></a></h5>
    <p>RUP is delivered to practitioners as an interactive Web site using industry-standard 
      browser technology. The tools used to deliver RUP include:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>
        <h5>The RUP Web site you are currently browsing.</h5>
        <p>A RUP Web site is a published process definition configured for your 
          project and tailored to your specific needs. The Web site is created 
          using dynamically generated HTML pages, which the RUP products enable 
          you to publish in the form of multiple RUP Web sites, each representing 
          a configured and tailored process definition.</p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <h5>A set of Web Browser navigation tools.</h5>
        <p>The RUP Browser applets enable the RUP Web site to be dynamically accessed 
          through a number of standard web browsers with the help of additional 
          navigation applets.</p>
      </li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>
    <h5><a name="ProcessConfigurationTools">Process Configuration Tools</a>.
	  <a href="#PlatformImage"><img src="../../images/top.gif" alt="Top" border="0" width="26" height="20"></a></h5>
	<p><a href="../../toolment/builder/builder.htm">RUP Builder</a> is a process 
      publication tool that allows Process Configurations to be created for different 
      needs and then published as a Web site for practitioners to access. RUP 
      Builder allows the optional inclusion of process extensions to the RUP using 
      the RUP Plug-In technology.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <h5>A <a name="CommunityMarketplace">Marketplace</a> for process extensions. 
      <a href="#PlatformImage"><img src="../../images/top.gif" alt="Top" border="0" width="26" height="20"></a></h5>
    <p>The <a href="../../process/rescenter.htm">Rational Developer Network<sup> 
      SM</sup></a> (RDN) provides a place for process engineers in the software 
      development community to share their process extensions as consumable Plug-In's, 
      and provides a rich source of process extensions for the project manager.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <h5><a name="ProcessAuthoringTools">Process Authoring Tools</a>.
	  <a href="#PlatformImage"><img src="../../images/top.gif" alt="Top" border="0" width="26" height="20"></a></h5>
	<p>The <a href="../../process/res_processworkbench.htm">Rational Process Workbench</a> 
      (RPW) tool is comprised of three components: RUP Organizer for managing 
      content libraries, RUP Modeler for defining process models that extend the 
      basic RUP process definition, and the RUP process engineering process. These 
      tools also provide a standardized mechanism for creating and transporting 
      process definition extensions as RUP Plug-IN's</p>
  </li>
</ul>


<h3><a name="Whom">Whom is RUP for?</a>
 <a href="#Top"><img src="../../images/top.gif" alt="Top" border="0" width="26" height="20"></a></h3>
<p>If you depend on your ability to develop and deploy software which is critical 
  to the success of your organization, then RUP will help you. The RUP product 
  family is developed with two primary groups of users in mind:</p>
<ul>
  <li>software development practitioners working as part of a project team, including 
    the stakeholders of those software development projects.<br>
    <br></li>
  <li>process engineering practitioners, specifically software process engineers 
    and managers.</li>
</ul>
<p>Software development practitioners can find guidance on what is required of 
  them in the <a href="kc_role.htm">roles defined in RUP</a>. A practitioner working 
  on a RUP software engineering project is assigned one or more of the roles defined 
  in RUP, where each role partitions a set of activities and artifacts that role 
  is responsible for. Guidance is also given on how those roles collaborate in 
  terms of the <a href="kc_wkfldet.htm">detailed work</a> that is required to 
  enact the <a href="kc_it_workflow.htm">workflow within an iteration</a>.</p>
<p>Process Engineering practitioners can find guidance on defining, configuring, 
  tailoring and <a href="../../process/workflow/environm/co_iproj.htm">implementing</a> 
  engineering processes. The RUP product family provides <a href="../../process/res_processworkbench.htm">a 
  number of tools</a> that enable and simplify defining, configuring and tailoring 
  the engineering process.</p>
<p>A number of <a href="../myrup/tree_browser.htm#_Types_of_Trees">process views</a> 
  are provided with the RUP product that are focused on different groups of software 
  engineering practitioners.</p>


<h3><a name="Why">Why should I use RUP?</a> <a href="#Top"><img src="../../images/top.gif" alt="Top" border="0" width="26" height="20"></a></h3>
<p>RUP provides a software development practitioner with a standards-based yet 
  configurable process environment. That process environment:</p>
<ul>
  <li>allows a <a href="../../toolment/builder/builder.htm">tailored engineering 
    process to be published</a> and <a href="../../process/navtools.htm">made 
    accessible to the entire project team</a>.<br></li>
  <li>allows that engineering process to be <a href="../../toolment/builder/tm_configure_process.htm">configured</a> 
    to suit the unique needs of each project.<br></li>
  <li>provides each user with <a href="../myrup/tree_browser.htm">customized filtering</a> 
    of the published process definition.<br></li>
</ul>
<p>At it's heart, RUP is a collected body of software engineering practices that 
  are regarded as representative of many <a href="im_diff.htm">continually improved 
  on a regular basis</a> to reflect changes in industry practices.</p>
<p>As a <a href="../../process/workers/wk_sthld.htm">stakeholder</a> in a software 
  development project, RUP provides you with an understanding of what can be expected 
  from the development effort. It provides a glossary of terminology and an encyclopedia 
  of knowledge to help you communicate your needs effectively with the software 
  development team.</p>
<p>As a <a href="../../process/workers/ovu_works.htm">software development practitioner</a>, 
  this process environment provides a central, common process definition that 
  all software development team members can share, helping to ensure clear and 
  unambiguous communication between team members. This helps you to play the part 
  expected of you in the project team by making it clear what your responsibilities 
  are. As a general software engineering reference, RUP provides a wealth of guidance 
  on software development practices that novice and experienced practitioners 
  alike will find valuable. Even if you are a lone code-warrior, you will find 
  RUP a useful mentor in helping you to build world-class software.</p>
<p>As a <a href="../../process/workers/ovu_works.htm">manager</a> or 
  team leader, RUP provides you with a process by which you can communicate effectively 
  with your staff and manage the planning and control of their work accordingly.</p>
<p>As a <a href="../../process/workers/wk_prcen.htm">process engineer</a>, RUP provides you with a good architectural foundation 
  and wealth of material from which you can construct your process definition, 
  enabling you to configure and extend that foundation as desired. This will save 
  you enormous amounts of time and effort that would otherwise be required to 
  create such a process definition from scratch.</p>


<h3><a name="When">When should I use RUP?</a> <a href="#Top"><img src="../../images/top.gif" alt="Top" border="0" width="26" height="20"></a></h3>
<p>
  <img src="../../process/modguide/images/complex.gif" border="0" alt="The Rational Unified Process Platform" width="467" height="390"> 
</p>
<p>RUP can be used right from the start of a new software project, and can continue 
  to be used in subsequent development cycles long after the initial project has 
  ended. However, the way in which RUP is used needs to be <a href="../../process/modguide/md_prodi.htm">varied appropriately 
  to suit your needs</a>. There are a few considerations that will alter when and 
  how you will use different parts of RUP:</p>
<ul>
  <li>project <a href="../../process/itrwkfls/iwf_iwfs.htm">lifecycle</a> (number 
    of <a href="../../process/workflow/manageme/co_phase.htm">iterations</a>, 
    length of each phase, project length)<br></li>
  <li>project <a href="../../process/artifact/ar_bcase.htm">business goals</a>, 
    <a href="../../process/artifact/ar_vsion.htm">project vision</a>, scope and 
    <a href="../../process/workflow/manageme/co_risk.htm">risk</a><br></li>
  <li>size of the Software Development Effort </li>
</ul>


<h3><a name="How">How do I get started?</a> <a href="#Top"><img src="../../images/top.gif" alt="Top" border="0" width="26" height="20"></a></h3>
<p>One of the core practices behind RUP is iterative and incremental development. 
  This practice is also good to keep in mind as you start with RUP: don't try 
  to &quot;do&quot; all of RUP at once. Adopt an approach to <a href="../../process/workflow/environm/co_iproj.htm">implementing</a>, 
  learning and using RUP that is itself iterative and incremental. Start by assessing 
  your existing process and selecting one or two key areas you would like to improve. 
  Begin using RUP to improve these areas first and then, in later iterations or 
  development cycles, make incremental improvements in other areas.</p>
