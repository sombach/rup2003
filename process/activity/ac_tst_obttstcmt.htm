<p>By asking the development team to develop software with specific provision 
  for the test effort, you will be adding further requirements and constraints 
  to the development effort; that essentially equates to more work and additional 
  risk and complexity for the development team. Some development teams will view 
  designing for testability as outside the scope of their responsibility. In other 
  cases, the testability needs will have to compete for the development resources 
  against customer needs and requirements that will usually be given more priority. 
  As such, you need to &quot;sell&quot; the benefits of the testability needs 
  to the project manager, software architect and other development team stakeholders.</p>
<p>Formulate an analysis of the benefits of each testability need you want to 
  obtain commitment for. Research papers, article and studies that support the 
  value of your testability need, and make use of ROI statistics where available. 
  Think of the benefits in terms of the value provided to the development team; 
  what useful evaluation information will you be able to provide to them that 
  could not be provided without this need being met? How will this make it easier 
  or more efficient for you to give the development team timely, accurate, in-depth 
  or useful feedback during each build cycle? Does this need provide the development 
  team with a useful feature that can be used in their own test effort or in future 
  diagnosis of software failure? In the case of competition against customer needs, 
  consider ways you can show that providing a solution to the testability need 
  earlier will provide additional opportunities for customer requirements to be 
  supported in subsequent build cycles.</p>

<p>Given that you will be imposing potentially additional work or risk on the 
  development team, you should identify and engage with those influential stakeholders 
  who have the ability to approve or mandate the support of testability. Do this 
  as soon as possible, before actively promoting the testability needs you want 
  supported.</p>
<p>The three most important stakeholders are the software architect, the project 
  manager and the customer representative. Spend time with the software architect 
  and promote the value of creating a software architecture that supports testability. 
  Spend time with the project manager and promote the benefits of testability 
  in terms of test team productivity and fast turn around on evaluation information. 
  Encourage the customer to place value on a quality product being delivered.</p>

  <p></p>
</div>

<p>It's important to promote testability needs in the right way. Each combination 
  of project manager, development team and customer stakeholders has a different 
  social dynamic and culture, and it's important to be sensitive to that when 
  you promote testability needs. As general heuristics, don't mount a formal testability 
  &quot;campaign&quot; if the team is relatively laid-back and informal; and don't 
  use an informal approach in a high-ceremony project.</p>
<p>In some cases, a collaborative &quot;brainstorming&quot; session is a useful 
  presentation format, where the need is presented as a challenge to the development 
  team, and they are encouraged to identify creative solutions to meet the testability 
  need(s). This encourages their ownership of the solution and fosters a feeling 
  of partnership in the effort. </p>
<p>Timing is also important for this step. As a general rule, you should try to 
  identify and promote the most important testability issues as early as possible, 
  generally during the Elaboration, and where possible the Inception phase. When 
  testability issues are raised in these early stages of the project, the team 
  is typically smaller and is more receptive to change. It's also easier to include 
  these needs in the evolving design as minimal rework is usually required.</p>
<p>A good place to identify testability needs and present them in a positive and 
  less &quot;official&quot; manner is to have the test team offer their services 
  in evaluating proof-of-concept activities and in evaluating the selection of 
  third-party components for use in the development effort. In particular, the 
  involvement of test teams during database component selection, UI control or 
  component selection, middleware components etc. means that testability issues 
  can be used as one aspect of the component selection criteria. For example, 
  in many cases development teams will have minimal concern over which UI widget 
  library to make use of; if one library is more testable than another, the development 
  team will be happy to select the more testable widget library.</p>
<p>If you've had trouble identifying or engaging with testability champions, you 
  may need to consider either an approach that introduces the changes more incrementally 
  making them potentially less risky and smaller blocks of effort, or you may 
  have to escalate the most important testability needs as critical project issues 
  that prevent the test effort from being successful until they are resolved. 
  In the latter case, we recommend you carefully consider all your options before 
  deciding on this course of action.</p>

<h3><a name="GainTestabilityCommitment">Gain commitment to support and maintain

</table>
  <p></p>
</div>

<p>It's important to ensure the testability needs are regarded in the same way 
  as any other requirement or constraint placed on the development effort. You 
  need to be assured that the testability features made available today will not 
  be abandoned tomorrow.</p>
<p>In some cases, attempting to gain this commitment may result in the development 
  team refusing to develop or support the testability needs. While this can be 
  disheartening, it's better to be aware of this situation and deal with the reality 
  of it at as early as possible; it's much worse to have spent extensive time 
  and effort developing a test implementation that the development team then abandon 
  uncommitted support for.</p>


<h3><a name="AdvocateTestabilityIssues">Advocate the resolution of testability issues</a> <a href="#Top"><img src="../../images/top.gif"alt="To top of page" border="0" width="26" height="20"></a></h3>

</div>

<p>While the development team may agree to provide the necessary support for the 
  testability needs of the test effort, it's important that you take an active 
  interest in the design, implementation and completion of this work. Don't simply 
  abandon concern because the development team have agreed to address the testability 
  needs or have begun work on a solution; you need to ensure that an appropriate 
  solution is developed in a timely manner.</p>
<p>Make yourself and the other test team staff readily available to answer the 
  development teams questions, and offer to evaluate the prototypes as soon as 
  they are built. Offer constructive feedback and show enthusiasm for the effort 
  the development team have put into helping meet your needs. Offer to have your 
  key staff attend or facilitate design workshops for the more complex testability 
  needs, but guard against your team being overbearing and controlling the solution 
  space of the design process for the developers.</p>
<p>Where issues arise and you feel they are not getting adequate attention, or 
  being addressed with the necessary haste, raise your concerns with the software 
  architect and project manager. Have the project manager log an issue on the 
  project issue list if appropriate.</p>

<br>
</div>

<p>Now that you have completed the work, it is beneficial to verify that the work 
  was of sufficient value, and that you did not simply consume vast quantities 
  of paper. You should evaluate whether your work is of appropriate quality, and 
  that it is complete enough to be useful to those team members who will make 
  subsequent use of it as input to their work. Where possible, use the checklists 
  provided in RUP to verify that quality and completeness are &quot;good enough&quot;.</p>
<p>Have the people performing the downstream activities that rely on your work 
  as input take part in reviewing your interim work. Do this while you still have 
  time available to take action to address their concerns. You should also evaluate 
  your work against the key input artifacts to make sure you have represented 
  them accurately and sufficiently. It may be useful to have the author of the 
  input artifact review your work on this basis.</p>
<p>Try to remember that that RUP is an iterative process and that in many cases 
  artifacts evolve over time. As such, it is not usually necessary&#151;and is 
  often counterproductive&#151;to fully-form an artifact that will only be partially 
  used or will not be used at all in immediately subsequent work. This is because 
  there is a high probability that the situation surrounding the artifact will 
  change&#151;and the assumptions made when the artifact was created proven incorrect&#151;before 
  the artifact is used, resulting in wasted effort and costly rework. Also avoid 
  the trap of spending too many cycles on presentation to the detriment of content 
  value. In project environments where presentation has importance and economic 
  value as a project deliverable, you might want to consider using an administrative 
  resource to perform presentation tasks.</p>
