<p>There are different ways to approach this step, and much of the approach will 
  depend on your project culture. Where available, gather and collate progress 
  reports prepared by individual team members or sub-teams. Project time sheets 
  are another possible source to consider. Where project scheduling systems such 
  as Microsoft Project are actively used and updated with actual progress this 
  provides another useful information source. Where available and actively used, 
  you might also derive objective status or progress metrics from configuration 
  and change management systems.</p>
<p>For this step and subsequent steps that deal with gathering information and 
  assessing the test effort, try to obtain a balanced view incorporating both 
  objective and subjective measures. Remember that objective numbers only give 
  part of the picture and need to be supported and explained by the current project 
  &quot;climate&quot;. Conversely, don't rely purely on hearsay and subjective 
  speculation about the test effort: look for supporting objective evidence. We 
  recommend you supplement your objective data by discussion with either team 
  leads or where possible individual team members to gather subjective assessments 
  and gauge how much confidence you can place in the objective data.</p>

        of the testing performed by the test team.&nbsp;</td>
    </tr>
  </tbody>
</table>
<br>
</div>

<p>Investigate how much effort has been spent on the identification, definition, 
  design, implementation and execution of tests. Keep an eye out for signs of 
  excessive effort being devoted to one aspect of the test effort to the detriment 
  of others. Look also for areas where effort may be unproductive or not showing 
  sufficient benefit for the level of effort being expended.</p>
<p>Look also at the effectiveness of the testing. Look for data that supports 
  your initial observations of effectiveness. Consider aspects such as defect 
  discovery rate, defect severity counts, duplicate defect statistics, and defects 
  detected as test escapes.</p>


<h3><a name="CRMetrics">Gather Change Request distribution, trend and aging metrics</a> 
  <a href="#Top"><img src="../../images/top.gif" alt="To top of page" border="0" width="26" height="20"></a></h3>

    <tr>
      <td width="5%"><b>Purpose:</b>&nbsp;</td>
      <td width="95%">To gather and examine objective data that enables the assessment 
        of the issues and defects logged by the test team.&nbsp;</td>
    </tr>
  </tbody>
</table>
<br>
</div>

<p>Identify important trends evident in the Change Request data. In general it's 
  less important for this activity to spend time analyzing data volumes and more 
  important to identify what the relative data trends are indicating. Look for 
  positive signs such as a steady, continuous rate of defect discovery, or a light 
  ongoing increase or decrease in discovery rate over time. Be on the lookout 
  for sharp peaks and troughs in discovery rate that indicate the test team may 
  be encountering process, environmental, political or other problems that are 
  reducing their productivity.</p>
<p>Look at trends in defects closures. Look for significant increases of closures 
  by development staff as &quot;not reproducible&quot;; identify cases where this 
  is a result of insufficient analysis of the failure having been performed by 
  the test team and quantify the extent of this problem. Look at trends in defects 
  being closed by development staff as &quot;functioning as designed&quot;; identify 
  cases where this is a result of insufficient analysis of the specification having 
  been performed by the test team and quantify the extent of this problem. Be 
  careful to confirm these indications are not false and due instead to overworked 
  developers triaging their workload. Some analysis should also be done of defect 
  verification trends as fixes to defects are released to the test team in subsequent 
  builds: look out for trends that indicate defects awaiting verification by the 
  test team are aging or growing to an unmanageable number.</p>
<p>Look for other trends that indicate problems. Look at the the way in which 
  defects and other change requests have been recorded or managed by the test 
  team: ambiguous and insufficient information on a change request is difficult 
  and frustrating for a developer to take action on. The team should take care 
  to monitor that the quality of the information recorded against defects remains&#151;on 
  average&#151;relatively high. Take the opportunity to improve the clarity of 
  the associated Change Requests, eliminating ambiguity and emotive language and 
  reasoning. Work together with the individuals who created these artifacts to 
  ensure the essence of the problem is clearly stated and encourage them to find 
  factual and accurate ways to approach discussing the Issues.</p>
<p>Also look out for imbalances in defect distribution on a number of different 
  dimensions. Look for functional areas of the application or the specification 
  that have low defect counts raised against them: this may indicate an exposure 
  that insufficient testing has been undertaken in that functional area. Look 
  also at distribution by test team member: there may be indications that individual 
  team members are overworked and that productivity is suffering.</p>

</div>

<p>Analyze the state of the traceability relationships between the testing assets&#151;Test 
  Ideas, Test Cases, Test Scripts, Test Suites and Change Requests&#151;and the 
  upstream and downstream assets they relate to. Look for signs that indicate 
  the test effort is focused on the correct areas and a useful set of motivations. 
  Look also for negative indications that suggest certain aspects of testing are 
  missing or are no longer of importance: If the requirements or development teams 
  are working on areas not represented by the current test effort, this should 
  raise concerns.</p>


<h3><a name="EvaluateMetrics">Evaluate metrics and formulate initial assessment</a>

<br>
</div>

<p>Collate all of the information you have gathered and evaluate it as a collective 
  whole. Remember that each piece of the data gathered only addresses one aspect 
  of the total assessment, and you must formulate your assessment of the test 
  effort based on a balanced and considered view of all data.</p>
<p>Record you initial assessment in a format that will be suitable for the stakeholders 
  to make comments and give feedback on.</p>


<h3><a name="RecordFindings">Record findings</a>

        earlier assessments.&nbsp;</td>
    </tr>
  </tbody>
</table>
<br>
</div>

<p>This activity produces summary status information that is important to the 
  project manager and other roles in the management team. These roles will use 
  the summary findings to make informed decisions about the project.</p>
<p>We recommend your record some aspects of the test effort assessment in a format 
  that allows subsequent assessments to be compared and contrasted with previous 
  ones. This will enable you to analyze the relative trend in test effort improvements 
  over time.</p>


<h3><a name="PresentAssessment">Present assessment and gather feedback</a>

        the actual testing effort is serving their needs.&nbsp;</td>
    </tr>
  </tbody>
</table>
<br>
</div>

<p>Present your assessment for stakeholders to comment and offer feedback on. 
  The format or method for doing this will differ from project to project: in 
  some cases it will be a series of informal conversations, in another simply 
  a posting on a project intranet web-site, and in others a formal presentation&#151;choose 
  a format that suits your culture.</p>
<p>Even with the best planning and specification documents possible, there will 
  usually be differences between the original expectation and intent of those 
  documents and the resulting end product. This is as true for testing and evaluating 
  software as it is for the software development itself. The value of this step 
  is to take the opportunity to elicit the stakeholders feedback and identify 
  where the careful planning and documentation has not achieved what was originally 
  expected or intended.</p>

    </tr>
  </tbody>
</table>
<br>
</div>

<p>Based on your analysis and the feedback you've received from various stakeholders, 
  identify opportunities for improvement. Look for ways to make the testing more 
  effective, productive and efficient. This might involve: reassigning staff, 
  including pairing staff to work more effectively or employing specialized contractors; 
  using productivity tools to improve efficiency; finding alternative approaches 
  and techniques that are more productive in terms of finding defects.</p>
<p>In most cases it's better to make small, incremental improvements to the test 
  effort and avoid the risk of derailing the project with large, unsettling changes: 
  In some cases a bigger change is warranted and useful. Use your best judgment 
  to formulate an appropriate approach to improvement and discuss your ideas with 
  other management staff to get their input before committing the team to embrace 
  large changes. </p>


<h3><a name="ManageImprovements">Monitor and support improvement initiatives</a>

<br>
</div>

<p>For the improvements to be effective, you will need to manage their success. 
  Identify ways that you will be able to monitor improvement initiatives&#151;preferably 
  in advance on their adoption&#151;to assess their effectiveness. Either actively 
  monitor the progress being made in adopting the changes yourself, or appoint 
  someone else on the team to do so.</p>
<p>Most changes meet resistance or problems that must be overcome for them to 
  be ultimately successful. Allow time for and be prepared to quickly address 
  any issues that arise and prevent the initiative from succeeding. Be sensitive 
  to peoples natural reluctance to change and find ways to address their concerns 
  appropriately.</p>


<h3><a name="EvaluateResults">Evaluate and verify your results</a> <a href="#Top"><img src="../../images/top.gif"alt="To top of page" border="0" width="26" height="20"></a></h3>

<br>
</div>

<p>Now that you have completed the work, it is beneficial to verify that the work 
  was of sufficient value, and that you did not simply consume vast quantities 
  of paper. You should evaluate whether your work is of appropriate quality, and 
  that it is complete enough to be useful to those team members who will make 
  subsequent use of it as input to their work. Where possible, use the checklists 
  provided in RUP to verify that quality and completeness are &quot;good enough&quot;.</p>
<p>Have the people performing the downstream activities that rely on your work 
  as input take part in reviewing your interim work. Do this while you still have 
  time available to take action to address their concerns. You should also evaluate 
  your work against the key input artifacts to make sure you have represented 
  them accurately and sufficiently. It may be useful to have the author of the 
  input artifact review your work on this basis.</p>
<p>Try to remember that that RUP is an iterative process and that in many cases 
  artifacts evolve over time. As such, it is not usually necessary&#151;and is 
  often counterproductive&#151;to fully-form an artifact that will only be partially 
  used or will not be used at all in immediately subsequent work. This is because 
  there is a high probability that the situation surrounding the artifact will 
  change&#151;and the assumptions made when the artifact was created proven incorrect&#151;before 
  the artifact is used, resulting in wasted effort and costly rework. Also avoid 
  the trap of spending too many cycles on presentation to the detriment of content 
  value. In project environments where presentation has importance and economic 
  value as a project deliverable, you might want to consider using an administrative 
  resource to perform presentation tasks.</p>
