<h4>To initiate the risk list (in the inception phase):</h4>
<p>Gather the project team together (which at this point should be quite small;
if there are more than five to seven people on the project team, limit the risk assessment
process to the activity leaders).</p>
<p>When we identify risks, we consider 'what can go wrong'. At the broadest
level, of course, everything can go wrong. The point is not to cast a
pessimistic view on the project, however; we want to identify potential barriers
to success so that we can reduce or eliminate them. For more information, see <a href="../modguide/md_rskli.htm">Guidelines:
Risk List</a>.</p>
<p>More specifically, we are looking for the events which might occur which
would decrease the likelihood that we will be able to deliver the project with
the right features, the requisite level of quality, on time and within budget.</p>
<p>Using brainstorming techniques, ask each member to identify a project risk.
Clarification questions are allowed, but the risks should not be evaluated or
commented on by the group. Go around the table until no more risks can be
identified.</p>
<p>Involve all parties in this process, and don't worry too much about form or
duplicates; you can clean up the list later. Use homogeneous groups of people
(customers, users, technical people, and so on). This eases the process of
collecting risks; individuals are less inhibited in front of their peers (in
specialty and hierarchy) than in a large mix.</p>
<p>Make clear to the participants that raising a risk does not equate in any way
with volunteering to address the risk. If there is any sense that raising a risk
will result in becoming responsible for addressing the risk, no one will
identify any risks (or the risks they do raise will be trivial).</p>
<p>To prime the pump, try starting with generic risk lists such as <b>Assessment
and Control of Software Risks</b> by Capers Jones [<a href="../referenc.htm#JON94">JON94</a>]
or <b>the Taxonomy-Based Risk Identification</b> established by the
Software Engineering Institute [<a href="../referenc.htm#CAR93">CAR93</a>].
Circulate the risk list: seeing what has been already identified often helps
people to identify more.</p>
<h4>To update the risk list (in later phases):</h4>
<p>You may solicit input as identified above. But generally, based on the
example of the existing list, new risks will be identified by the team members,
and captured at the regular project Status Assessment. See <a href="ac_evitr.htm">Activity:
Assess Iteration</a>.</p>
<h3><a name="Analyze and Prioritize Risks">Analyze and Prioritize Risks</a> <a href="#Top"><img src="../../images/top.gif" alt="To top of page" border="0" width="26" height="20"></a></h3>

	  To rank the risks in terms of their impact on the project.&nbsp;
	</td>
  </tr>
</table>
<br>
</div>

<p>When no more risks are being found, look at the risk list as a group to see
if there are any natural groupings (occurrences of the same risk), and combine
risks where possible to eliminate duplicates. Sometimes, the risks identified
will be symptoms of some more fundamental risk; in this case, group the related
risks together under the more fundamental risk.</p>
<p>Quantitative risk management techniques recommend that risks be prioritized
according to the overall risk exposure the risk represents to the project. To
determine the exposure for each risk the group should estimate the following
information:</p>

<table border="0" width="100%">
  <tr>
    <td width="26%"><b>Impact of risk</b>&nbsp;</td>
    <td width="74%">The deviations of schedule, effort, or costs from plan if the risk occurs&nbsp;</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td width="26%"><b>Likelihood of Occurrence</b>&nbsp;</td>
    <td width="74%">The probability that the risk will actually occur (usually
    expressed as a percentage)&nbsp;</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td width="26%"><b>Risk Exposure</b>&nbsp;</td>
    <td width="74%">Calculated by multiplying the Impact by the Likelihood of
    Occurrence&nbsp;</td>
  </tr>
</table>
<p>As a group, the exposure of each risk should be derived by consensus.
Significant differences of opinion should be further discussed to see if
everyone is interpreting the risk the same way. Typically this information is
included as columns in a tabular <u>Risk List</u>.</p>
<p>It is human nature to worry about the highest impact risks, but if these are
very unlikely to occur they are really less important than more moderate risks
that are often overlooked. By considering both the magnitude of the risk and its
likelihood of occurrence, this approach helps project managers focus their risk
management efforts in areas that will have the most significant affect on
project delivery.</p>
<p>Once the exposure for each risk has been determined, you can sort the risks
in order of decreasing exposure to create your &quot;top 10&quot; Risks List.</p>
<p>Because estimation of likelihood and cost is expensive and risky in itself,
it is generally only useful to gauge the impact of the top 10 to 20 risks.
Smaller projects may consider fewer risks, whereas larger projects present a
larger &#145;risk target&#146; and as a result have a larger number of relevant risks.</p>
<p>In addition to ranking the risks in descending order of exposure, you may
also find it useful to group or cluster the risks into categories, based on the
magnitude of their impact on the project (risk magnitude). In most cases, five
categories is sufficient:
<ol>
  <li>High</li>
  <li>Significant</li>
  <li>Moderate</li>
  <li>Minor</li>
  <li>Low</li>
</ol>
<p>Document the risks and circulate them among the project team members.</p>

</table>
<br>
</div>

<p>While not always possible, sometimes you can side-step risks altogether.
Often risk is caused by poor system scope; if you can reduce the scope of the
system (by eliminating non-essential requirements), whole sections of the risk
list go tumbling off with the dropped requirements. Not the least of these risks
is that of not having enough resources (including time) to do the work.</p>
<p>In other cases, technology can be acquired to reduce the risk of building
particular functionality, a form of risk avoidance in which one set of risks
(that of building the technology) is exchanged for another (that of being
dependent upon forces outside one's control).</p>
<p>Finally risk can be transferred to other organizations.</p>
<h3><a name="Identify Risk MitigationStrategies">Identify Risk Mitigation

<br>
</div>

<p>For direct risks, that is,&nbsp; risks for which the project has some degree of
control, identify what actions will be taken to reduce the probability of the
risk, or to reduce its impact on the project (the mitigation strategies).
Typically, the risk itself derives from lack of information; often, the
mitigation strategy itself is one of investigating the topic further the reduce
the uncertainty.</p>
<p>There are risks for which some action can be taken to either make the risk
materialize or retire it. In an iterative development process, allocate such
actions to early iterations to mitigate the risk as early as possible. Confront
the risks as early as possible. if a risk is in the form &quot;X may not
work?&quot;, then plan to try X as soon as possible.</p>
<p><b>Examples:</b>
<ul>
  <li>To reduce the risk that products X and Y cannot be integrated, a prototype
    will be built to investigate the difficulty of integration. The following
    features (enumerate in a list) will be tested to ensure the integration is
    successful.</li>
  <li>To reduce the risk that Database A will not perform adequately, it will be
    benchmarked using a suite of tests which model the workload of the target
    application.</li>
  <li>To reduce the risk that test tool Z will not be able to effectively
    regression test the application, we will acquire and use it during the
    upcoming iteration.</li>
</ul>
<p>The result of these actions should be to reduce the probability that certain
risks will occur, perhaps to near zero. In cases where the risk is confirmed,
the risk is responded to with a contingency plan (See <a href="#Identify Risk Response Strategies">Identify
Contingency Strategies</a>).</p>

</div>

<p>For each risk, whether you have a plan to actively mitigate it or not, you
must decide what actions are to be taken when or if the risk materializes, that is,
if it becomes a problem, a 'loss event' in insurance jargon. This is commonly
called &quot;a plan 'B'&quot; or contingency plan. A contingency plan is needed
when risk avoidance and risk transfer have failed, mitigation was not that
successful, and now the risk must be addressed head-on. This is very often the
case for indirect risks, that is, the risks for which the project has no control, or
when the mitigation strategies are too costly to implement.</p>
<p>The contingency plan should consider:

      &quot;bleeding&quot;?)&nbsp;</td>
    </tr>

  </div>

</ul>
<h4>Identify Risk Indicators</h4>
<p>Some risks can be monitored using project metrics, looking at trends and
threshold; for example:
<ul>
  <li>Rework remaining too high</li>
  <li>Breakage remaining too high</li>
  <li>Actual expenditure far above plans</li>
</ul>
<p>Some risks can be monitored based on project requirements and test results;
for example:
<ul>
  <li>Response times one order of magnitude above requirement.</li>
</ul>
<p>Some risks are associated to specific event; for example:
<ul>
  <li>Software component not delivered in time by third party.</li>
</ul>
<p>There are many other, &quot;softer&quot; indicators, none of which will fully
diagnose the problem. For example, there is always a risk that morale will drop
(in fact, at certain points in the project, this is almost (predictable). There
are a number of indicators: grumbling, &quot;gallows humor&quot;, missed
deadlines, poor quality, and so on. No one of these &quot;measures&quot; is a sure
indicator; joking about the futility of a particular deliverable can be a
healthy way of relieving stress, but if it continues, it may be an indication
that the team feels an increasing sense of impending doom.</p>
<p>Listen to all indicators without passing judgment. It is easy to label the
bearer of 'bad news' as someone who has a bad attitude; behind cynicism there is
often more than a grain of truth. Often, the 'bearer of bad news' is acting as
the 'conscience of the project'. Most people want the project to succeed, and
they feel frustrated when momentum is carrying the project in the other
direction.</p>
<h4>Identify &quot;Loss&quot; Actions, or &quot;Plan B&quot;</h4>
<p>For simple cases, the contingency plan enumerates alternate solutions. The
impact is usually costs and delays to scrap the current solution and implement
the new one.</p>
<p>For other, &quot;softer&quot; risks is often not one action to take when a
loss has occurred, but several. When morale drops, for example, it is best to
acknowledge the condition and gather as a group to discuss the prevailing
attitudes on the project. Listen to concerns, identify issues, and generally let
people vent. After an appropriate amount of venting, though, move on to address
the causes of concern. Use the risk list as a way to focus the discussion.
Translate the concerns into a concrete action plan by reprioritizing risks and
then reformulating the iteration plans to systematically address the top risks.
Positive action has a stronger effect than positive (but empty) words.</p>
<p>Despite the mood at the time, a loss occurrence has a positive side: it
forces action. Too often it is easy to postpone risks by ignoring them, lulled
into complacency by the apparent quiet. When a loss event occurs, action is
required. The risk is no longer a risk, there is no longer any uncertainty about
its occurrence.</p>
<p>Yet a loss occurrence is also a failure to avoid or mitigate risk. It should
force a re-examination of the risk list to determine whether the project team
may have some systematic blind-spots. As difficult as frank self-assessment is,
it may prevent other problems later on.</p>

<p>Risk assessment is actually a continuous process, rather than one which
occurs only at specific intervals during the project. At minimum, you should:
<ul>
  <li>Revisit your list weekly to see what has changed.</li>
  <li>Make the top ten items visible to the whole project and insist on action
    being taken on them. Often you would attach the current risk list to your
    Status Assessment reports.</li>
</ul>

  </tr>
</table>
<br>
</div>

<p>At the end of an iteration, refocus on the goals of the iteration with
respect to the risk list. Specifically:
<ul>
  <li>Eliminate risks that have been fully mitigated.</li>
  <li>Introduce new risks recently discovered.</li>
  <li>Reassess the magnitude and reorder the risk list (see <a href="#Analyze and Prioritize Risks">Analyze
    and Prioritize Risks</a>).</li>
</ul>
<p>Do not be too concerned if you discover that the list of risk grows during
the inception and elaboration phases. As project members do the work, they
realize that something they thought was trivial actually contains risks. As you
begin doing integration, you may find some hidden difficulty. However the risks
should steadily decrease as the project reaches the end of elaboration and
during construction. If not, you may not be handling risks appropriately or your
system is too complex, or impossible to build in a systematic and predictable
fashion. For more information see <a href="../modguide/md_rskli.htm">Guidelines:
Risk List</a>.</p><br>
