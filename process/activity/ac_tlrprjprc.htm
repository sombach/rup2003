  <p>It is crucial for the success of the project that the development process 
    is <b>relevant</b> for the project at hand, and for the size and formality 
    requirements of the project. Too much process tends to get in the way of creativity 
    and efficiency. Too little process can lead to a chaotic environment, typically 
    leading individual project members to make local decisions that may result 
    in inefficient, inconsistent and unpredictable results.</p>
  <p>Process ceremony varies a lot in different development organizations. Some 
    are very process mature, and have dedicated process groups to look after the 
    definition and improvements of the development process throughout the organization. 
    Others are concerned with project-specific tailoring only. These projects 
    will typically start with one of the predefined configurations that come with 
    the RUP product, and from there instantiate the process for every project. 
    The approach taken to tailor the process for the project, depends heavily 
    on several factors, for instance :</p>
</div>
<ul>
  <li> 
    <div align="left">The development organization's process maturity.</div>
  </li>
  <li> 
    <div align="left">The size of the project in terms of calendar time and number 
      of development resources.</div>
  </li>
  <li>The project members previous exposure to similar processes.</li>
  <li>The formality requirements of the project.</li>
</ul>
<p>See <a href="../modguide/md_prodi.htm">Guideline: Process Discriminants </a>for 
  details.</p>

<div align="left"> 
  <p>An assessment of the development organization, if available, indicates which 
    areas the development organization as a whole needs to focus on. An informed 
    decision on which of the identified improvement areas should be targeted for 
    the upcoming project needs to be made. This is further discussed in the next 
    section<i> Define the Scope of the Process.</i> See also <a href="../artifact/ar_deorv.htm">Artifact:

      </tbody> 
    </table>
    <p>The results of analyzing the project resources and their experience with 
      similar software development projects helps identify the scope of the tailoring 
      effort. A project-specific process does not have to include all the disciplines 
      in RUP, nor should it be necessary to cover all the roles defined in the 
      RUP. Keep in mind that the RUP is a process framework suitable for a wide 
      range of project types, and thus will be too much for one specific project 
      to follow. Which areas you select to cover in the project's process, depends 
      heavily upon the existing skill sets of the project members, and the nature 
      of the project at hand. Below are some typical considerations to make when 
      defining the scope of the tailoring effort.</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Areas where the project members already have a common way of working, 
        where it is not necessary to introduce a new process and tools. For example, 
        if they know how to test, it can be a good idea to not introduce the Test 
        discipline of the RUP to limit the number of new factors. You can focus 
        on introducing some parts of the RUP, to correct problems in their existing 
        process.&nbsp; See <a href="../workflow/environm/co_iproj.htm#Improving Process and Tools">Concepts: 
        Implementing a Process in a Project, section &quot;Improving Process and 
        Tools&quot;</a>, for details.&nbsp;</li>
      <li>Areas (disciplines) where the project must introduce new process and 
        tools, because there is no existing way of working. In some cases there 
        is no existing process and tools to fall back on, and it is necessary 
        to introduce most of the RUP, together with supporting tools. See <a href="../workflow/environm/co_iproj.htm#Change Everything">Concepts: 
        Implementing a Process in a Project, section &quot;Change Everything&quot;</a>, 
        for details.&nbsp;</li>
      <li>Problems in the existing process. Focus on improving areas in which 
        the organization has had problems.</li>
      <li>Which tools to use ? If the project has decided to use certain tools, 
        the development process should normally cover the corresponding areas 
        of the RUP.</li>
      <li>The project's capacity to change. When looking at the organization's 
        problems there is a tendency to try to fix everything at once, especially 
        since many of these problems occur together. This is usually a fatal trap. 
        Organizations just like individuals can accommodate change but only within 
        a limited range. If the capacity to change is low, you have to go slower, 
        and maybe just introduce one or two disciplines of the RUP in the first 
        project.</li>
      <li>Areas where the project's members lack knowledge, or are weak. Let the 
        development process cover these areas. Make sure that it is easy to find 
        the right information in the RUP.</li>
    </ul>
    <p> Identified improvement areas must not necessarily be introduced for the 
      first time in the same project. Reduce the number of unknown factors and 
      look at areas where the development organization has experienced the most 
      pain in the past. We recommend that you implement the RUP iteratively, as 
      described in the <a href="../workflow/environm/co_iproj.htm">Concepts: Implementing 
      a Process in a Project</a>. Although there might be discovered needs for 
      improvements within several disciplines, consider the option of introducing 
      them iteratively over the course of several projects rather than aiming 
      for a change-everything-at-once approach.</p>

    <p>One example of such a tradeoff is to introduce Requirements with Use-cases 
      and defer the introduction of a new CM process, if previous projects have 
      struggled with unclear and/or insufficient requirements, or if major complaints 
      have been made by end-users that the delivered product does not meet their 
      needs.</p>
    <p>The tradeoffs made should be documented to communicate the scoping decisions 
      to external stakeholders. When creating the configuration in the RUP Builder 
      product, these decisions can be documented as a description of the configuration 
      and will surface in the published Website. 
      You can also decide to document this in the project's Development Case under 
      the section titled &quot;Scope&quot;.</p>

<p>One of the strengths of the RUP process framework is that it is applicable 
  to a wide range of projects and environments. But this may at the same time 
  be perceived as a disadvantage too, because the process description tends to 
  become a bit too generic. The RUP plug-in technology is designed to overcome 
  some of these issues by allowing tool or technology vendors and individual companies 
  to create more specific process descriptions through plug-ins. <a href="../rescenter.htm#RUPPluginExchange">The 
  Rational Developer Network (RDN), RUP Plug-in Exchange</a> is a community where 
  RUP users discuss and exchange process know-how. You will always find an an 
  up-to-date list of available plug-ins for download.</p>
<p>The <a href="../res_processworkbench.htm">Rational Process Workbench&#153; 
  (RPW) product</a> enables the creation of RUP extensions using the RUP Plug-in 
  technology. Following the recommendations for this technology, the RUP framework 
  can be extended in two ways. You either create a structural plug-in to extend 
  the RUP process model, or you create extensions that will provide a development 
  organization's relevant reusable assets to the project through thin plug-ins. 
</p>
<p>Creating a RUP plug-in (structural) should be treated as a project in its own 
  right, with separate plans, budget and control mechanisms. You should define 
  a business case for it, based on return-on-investment analysis. The actual development 
  of the plug-in will benefit from following the lifecycle and disciplines in 
  the RUP. We recommend that you try out the main ideas behind the plug-in on 
  a real project before you start the project to develop the plug-in.</p>

<p>The RUP framework is built up of a set of process components and plug-ins, 
  each component contains a set of related process elements. Creating a RUP configuring 
  means selecting between a set of process components. Selecting the <b>right 
  </b>set of components for a given project is not a trivial task. To be effective, 
  the process needs to be relevant and right-sized along different dimensions, 
  like project size (resources and calendar time), formality, technological platform, 
  domain, just to mention a few. </p>

<p>A process description configured for a project is often not at the level of 
  details ready to be enacted. For example, the process defines a set of artifacts 
  to use based on a selection of relevant process components (as described in 
  the previous section <i>Create a RUP Configuration</i>), but it does not specify 
  timing and formality requirements of the artifacts for this particular project. 
  Prescriptive guidelines and partially instantiated artifact templates are also 
  considered to be part of an instantiated project-specific process. The required 
  effort to perform this step is highly dependent on the precision of the configured 
  process. Any such deviation from the underlying process should be justified 
  and documented as part of the project-specific process. </p>

<p>The work of instantiating the configured is described in detail in the following 
  activities, all performed by the Process Engineer : 
<ul>
  <li>See <a href="ac_devca.htm">Activity: Develop Development Case</a> for guidance 
    on how to define lifecycle model and selection and tailoring of artifacts.</li>
  <li>See <a href="ac_dvlprjspcgdl.htm">Activity: Prepare Guidelines for the Project

  <p>After the initial tailoring work is done, the resulting process needs to 
    be published into a consumable format. The RUP Builder product provides a 
    means to publish the configured process resulting in a RUP Website that contains 
    only the selected process components and resources. 
    See <a href="../../toolment/builder/tm_publish_configuration.htm">Tool Mentor: 
    Publish Process Configuration Using RUP Builder</a> for tool specific guidance. 
    The Process Engineer needs to work with the Project Manager to make the project-specific 
    process public, and decide on how to educate the project members. This can 
    vary from an informal 2 hour presentation to more formal training, depending 
    on the size of the project and the project members' familiarity with similar 
    development processes. Every significant update of the process during the 
    project lifecycle, should be re-launched to the project, focusing on the changes. 
  </p>
  <p>The Website for the project-specific process can be published to a Web server 
    on the organization's network, or installed on each individual team member's 
    computer. If the project members are connected to the network most of the 
    time, then deploying the RUP Website to a Web server is recommended to avoid 
    any overhead associated with updates to the process during the project lifecycle.</p>
   
  <p>See <a href="ac_ladev.htm">Activity: Launch Development Process</a> for further 
    information.</p>
   
  <h3><a name="MaintainProcess"></a>Maintain the Process <a href="#Top"><img src="../../images/top.gif"alt="To top of page" border="0" width="26" height="20"></a></h3>
  <p>Although the bulk of the tailoring work is done in the early days of the 
    project, it should be kept up-to-date continuously, as the project teams uncover 
    obstacles and other issues in the process. Assessments made during the project 
    are important input to improving the process. Minor adjustments are typically 
    handled by the project, and updates to the project-specific process are made 
    as part of preparing the development environment for the upcoming iteration. 
     
    These kind of process improvements will often lead to updates being made to 
    artifacts, such as development case, project-specific guidelines and project-specific 
    templates.  More complex issues are raised as change requests on the 
    process. This is usually handled by a process group outside the boundaries 
    of the project, that has the responsibility of the software development process 
    on an organizational basis. </p>
  <p>One of the major benefits of iterative development is that it allows the 
    project teams to gradually improve the way they develop software. We recommend 
    that every project include process engineering micro-cycles consisting of 
    the following steps :</p>
