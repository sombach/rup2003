  Learn as much as you can about each occurrence.</p>
<p>Check for duplicate incidents, common symptoms and other relationships between 
  incidents. These conditions often provide valuable insight into the root cause 
  of a group of the incidents.</p>

<h4><a name="VerifyIncidentFacts">Verify incident facts</a>
 <a href="#CreateMaintainCRs"><img src="../../images/top.gif" alt="To top of page" border="0" width="26" height="20"></a></h4>  

<p>Verify that there is accurate, supporting data available. Collate the data 
  for attachment directly to the Change Request, or reference where the data can 
  be obtained separately.</p>
<p>Whenever possible, verify that the problem is reproducible. Reproducible problems 
  have much more likelihood of receiving developer attention and being subsequently 
  fixed; a problem that cannot be reproduced both frustrates development staff 
  and will waste valuable programming resources in fruitless research. We recommend 
  that you still log these incidents, but that you consider identifying unreproducable 
  incidents separately from the reproducible ones.</p>

<h4><a name="ClarifyCRDetail">Clarify Change Request details</a>
 <a href="#CreateMaintainCRs"><img src="../../images/top.gif" alt="To top of page" border="0" width="26" height="20"></a></h4>  
<p>It's important for Change Requests to be understandable, especially the headline. 
  Make sure the headline is crisp and concise, articulating clearly the specific 
  issue. A brief headline is useful for summary defect listings and discussion 
  in <a href="../glossary.htm#CCB" target="_blank"><i>CCB</i></a> status meetings.</p>
<p>It's important that the detailed description of the Change Request is unambiguous 
  and can be easily interpreted. It's a good idea to log your Change Requests 
  as soon as possible, but take time to go back and improve and expand on your 
  descriptions before they are viewed by development staff.</p>
<p>Provide candidate solutions, as many as practical. This helps to reduce any 
  remaining ambiguity in the description, often helping to clarify. It also ensures 
  increases the likelihood that the solution will be close to your exceptions. 
  Furthermore, it shows that the test team is not only prepared to find the problems, 
  but also to help identify appropriate solutions.</p>
<p>Other details to include are screen image captures, Test Data files, automated 
  Test Scripts, output from diagnostic utilities and any other information that 
  would be useful to the developers in isolating and correcting the underlying 
  fault.</p>


<h4><a name="CRSeverityPriority">Indicate relative impact severity and resolution 
  priority</a> <a href="#Top"></a><a href="#CreateMaintainCRs"><img src="../../images/top.gif" alt="To top of page" border="0" width="26" height="20"></a></h4> 

<p>Provide an indication to the management and development staff of the severity 
  of the problem. In larger teams the actual resolution priority is normally left 
  for the management team to determine, however you might allow individuals to 
  indicate their preferred resolution priority and subsequently adjust as necessary. 
  As a general rule, we recommend you assign Change Requests an average resolution 
  priority by default, and raise or lower that priority on a case-by-case basis 
  as necessary.</p>
<p>You may need to differentiate between the impact the Change Request will have 
  on the production environment if it isn't addressed and the impact the Change 
  Request will have on the test effort if it isn't addressed; It's just as important 
  for the management team to know when a defect is impacting the testing effort 
  as it is to be aware of severity to end users.</p>
<p>Sometimes it's difficult to see in advance why you need both attributes. It's 
  possible that an incident may be really severe, such as a system crash, but 
  the actions required to reproduce it very unlikely to occur. In this case the 
  team may indicate it's severity as high, but indicate a very low resolution 
  priority.</p>


<h4><a name="LogAnotherCR">Log additional Change Requests separately </a><a href="#Top"><img src="../../images/top.gif" alt="To top of page" border="0" width="26" height="20"></a></h4> 

<p>Incidents often bare out the old adage&quot;Where there's smoke, there's fire&quot;; 
  as you identify and log one Change Request, you quite often identify other issues 
  that need to be addressed. Avoid the temptation to simply add these additional 
  findings to the existing Change Request: if the information is directly related 
  and helps to solve the existing issue better, then that's OK. If the other issues 
  are different, identifying them against an existing CR may result in those issues 
  not being actioned, not getting appropriate priority in their own right, or 
  impacting the speed at which other issues are addressed.</p>

  <h4><a name="IncidentData">Incident distribution</a> <a href="#Top"><img src="../../images/top.gif" alt="To top of page" border="0" width="26" height="20"></a></h4>

<p>Analyze the incidents based on where they are distributed, such as functional 
  area, quality risk, assigned tester and assigned developer.</p>

<p>Look for patterns in the distribution, such as functional areas that appear 
  to have above average defects count. Also look for both developers and testers 
  that may be overworked and where their quality of work is slipping</p>
<h4>
  <h4><a name="ExecutionCoverageData">Test execution coverage</a> <a href="#Top"><img src="../../images/top.gif" alt="To top of page" border="0" width="26" height="20"></a></h4>
  
</h4>
<p>To evaluate test execution coverage, you need to review the 
  Test Logs and determine:</p>
<ul>
  <li>The ratio between how many tests (Test Scripts or Test Cases) have been 
    performed in this Test Cycle and a total number of tests for all intended 
    Target Test Items.</li>
  <li>The ratio of successfully performed test cases.</li>
</ul>
<p>The objective is to ensure that a sufficient number of the tests targeted for 
  this Test Cycle have been executed usefully. If this is not possible, or to 
  augment that execution data, one or more additional test coverage criteria can 
  be identified, based upon: 
<ul>
  <li>Quality Risk or priority</li>
  <li>Specification-based coverage (Requirements etc.)</li>
  <li>Business need or priority</li>
  <li>Code-based coverage</li>
</ul>
<p>See &quot;<a href="../workflow/test/co_keyme.htm#Requirements-based test coverage">Concepts: Key Measures of Test, Requirements-based test coverage</a>&quot;.</p>
<p>Record an present the Test Results in an Test Evaluation Report for this Test 
  Cycle.</p>



<h4><a name="CRData">Change Requests statistics</a> <a href="#Top"> <img src="../../images/top.gif" alt="To top of page" border="0" width="26 height="20></a></h4> 

<p>To analyze defects, you need to review and analyze the measures chosen as part 
  of your defect analysis strategy. The most common defect measures used include 
  the following different measures (often displayed in the form of a graph): 
<ul>
  <li><b>Defect Density </b>- the number of defects are shown as a function of 
    one or two defect attributes (such as distribution over functional area or 
    quality risk compared to status or severity).</li>
  <li><b>Defect Trend </b>- the defect count is shown as a function over time.</li>
  <li><b>Defect Aging</b> - a special defect density report in which the defect 
    counts are shown as a function of the length of time a defect remained in 
    a given status (open, new, waiting-for-verification, etc.)</li>
</ul>
<p>Compare the measures from this Test Cycle to the running totals for the current 
  Iteration and those from the analysis of previous iterations, to better understand 
  the emerging trends over time.</p>
<p>It is recommended you present the results in diagram form with supporting findings 
  on request.</p>

<p>Present the Test Results for this Test Cycle in a Test Evaluation Summary. 
  This step is to develop the initial darft of the summary. This is accomplished 
  by assembling the previous information that has been gathered into a readable 
  summary report. Depending on the stakeholder audience and project context, the 
  actual format and content of the summary will differ.</p>
<p> Often it is a good idea to distribute the initial draft to a subset of stakeholders 
  to obtain feedback that you can incorporate before publishing to a broader audience.</p>

<p>Using whatever means is appropriate, publicize this information. We recommend 
  you consider posting these on a centralized project site, or present them in 
  regularly held status meetings to enable feedback to be gathered and next actions 
  to be determined.</p>
<p>Be aware that making evaluation summaries publicly available can sometimes 
  be a sensitive political issue. Negotiate with the development manager to present

<p>Now that you have completed the work, it is beneficial to verify that the work 
  was of sufficient value, and that you did not simply consume vast quantities 
  of paper. You should evaluate whether your work is of appropriate quality, and 
  that it is complete enough to be useful to those team members who will make 
  subsequent use of it as input to their work. Where possible, use the checklists 
  provided in RUP to verify that quality and completeness are &quot;good enough&quot;.</p>
<p>Have the people performing the downstream activities that rely on your work 
  as input take part in reviewing your interim work. Do this while you still have 
  time available to take action to address their concerns. You should also evaluate 
  your work against the key input artifacts to make sure you have represented 
  them accurately and sufficiently. It may be useful to have the author of the 
  input artifact review your work on this basis.</p>
<p>Try to remember that that RUP is an iterative process and that in many cases 
  artifacts evolve over time. As such, it is not usually necessary&#151;and is 
  often counterproductive&#151;to fully-form an artifact that will only be partially 
  used or will not be used at all in immediately subsequent work. This is because 
  there is a high probability that the situation surrounding the artifact will 
  change&#151;and the assumptions made when the artifact was created proven incorrect&#151;before 
  the artifact is used, resulting in wasted effort and costly rework. Also avoid 
  the trap of spending too many cycles on presentation to the detriment of content 
  value. In project environments where presentation has importance and economic 
  value as a project deliverable, you might want to consider using an administrative 
  resource to perform presentation tasks.</p>
