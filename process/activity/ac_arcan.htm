<p><a name="XE_modeling_conventions__defining"></a>Architectural analysis focuses 
  on defining a candidate architecture and constraining the architectural techniques 
  to be used in the system. It relies on gathering experience gained in similar 
  systems or problem domains to constrain and focus the architecture so that effort 
  is not wasted in architectural rediscovery. In systems where there is already 
  a well-defined architecture, architectural analysis might be omitted; architectural 
  analysis is primarily beneficial when developing new and unprecedented systems.</p>

<p>The architecture overview is created early in the lifecycle of a project, possibly 
  as early as the inception phase. It reflects early 
  decisions and working assumptions on implementing the Vision, as well as decisions 
  concerning the physical and logical architecture, and nonfunctional requirements 
  of the system. It's produced by the software architect, often in collaboration 
  with the project sponsor, and takes the form of an informal, rich picture storyboard 
  or iconic graph. Conceptually, it illustrates the essential nature of the proposed 
  solution, conveying the governing ideas and including the major building blocks. 
  The level of formality of the architectural overview is project dependent. For 
  example, in a large, high-ceremony project, it might be necessary to capture 
  the architecture overview in the appropriate sections of the Software Architecture 
  document, so it can be formally reviewed.</p>
<p>At this point the architecture overview is a provisional first pass. Do not 
  base commitments on the architecture overview diagram until an executable architectural 
  prototype has validated the architecture, including design, implementation, 
  and deployment concerns.</p>
<p>Consider basing the architecture on a reference architecture, other <a href="../workflow/ana_desi/co_swarch.htm#Architectural Patterns">architectural 
  patterns</a>, or other architectural assets.</p>
<p>Consider whether or not you wish to refine and maintain the architecture overview 
  diagram, to serve as a communication vehicle.</p>
<p>Many systems are constrained to be developed and deployed in an existing environment 
  of hardware and software; for these, the software architect will gather information 
  about the current environment.</p>
<p>For example, in an e-business system development the following information 
  is pertinent:</p>
<ul>
  <li>existing network logical and physical design</li>
  <li>existing databases and database design</li>
  <li>existing Web environment (servers, firewalls, and so forth)</li>
  <li>existing server environment (configuration, software versions, planned upgrades)</li>
  <li>existing standards (network, naming, protocols, and so on)</li>
</ul>


<p>Such information can be captured either textually, or in a <a href="../artifact/ar_dplmdl.htm">Deployment 
  Model</a>.</p>

<p>You need to understand the requirements of the environment for which assets 
  are being considered, and the system scope and general functionality required. 
  Search through organizational asset bases and industry literature to identify 
  assets or similar projects. There are several types of assets to consider, such 
  as (but not limited to) industry models, frameworks, classes, and experience. 
  You'll need to assess whether available assets contribute to solving the key 
  challenges of the current project and whether they are compatible with the project's 
  constraints.</p>
<p>You'll want to analyze the extent of the fit between asset and customer requirements, 
  considering whether any of the requirements are negotiable (to enable use of 
  the asset).</p>
<p>Be certain you assess whether the asset could be modified or extended to satisfy 
  requirements, and what the tradeoffs are in terms of cost, risk, and functionality 
  from adopting the asset.</p>
<p>Finally, you'll want to decide, in principle, whether to use one or more assets 
  and document the rationale for this decision.</p>

<p>When the focus is on performing the architectural synthesis during inception, 
  this step is excluded from this activity.</p>
<p>Normally the design model is organized in layers&#151a common <a href="../workflow/ana_desi/co_swarch.htm#Architectural Patterns">architectural 
  pattern</a> for moderate to large-sized systems. The number of layers is not 
  fixed, but varies from situation to situation.</p>
<p>During architectural analysis, you usually focus on the two high-level layers; 
  that is, the <b>application</b> and <b>business-specific</b> 
  layers. This is what is meant by the <i>high-level organization of subsystems</i>. 
  The other lower-level layers are considered in <a href="ac_incds.htm">Activity: 
  Incorporate Existing Design Elements</a>. If you're using specific architectural 
  patterns, the subsystems are defined around the architectural template for that 
  pattern.</p>

</div>
<p>When the focus is on performing the architectural synthesis, this step is done 
  to the extent necessary to guide the software architect in selecting assets 
  for the construction of the <a href="../artifact/ar_archpoc.htm">Artifact: Architectural 
  Proof-of-Concept</a> and to support representative usage scenarios.</p>
<p>Requirements and Business 
  Modeling activities usually uncover key concepts that the system must 
  be able to handle; these concepts manifest themselves as key design abstractions. 
  Because of the work already done, there is no need to repeat the identification 
  work again during <a href="ac_ucana.htm">Activity: Use Case Analysis</a>.</p>
<p>You can take advantage of existing knowledge by identifying preliminary entity 
  analysis classes to represent these key abstractions on the basis of general 
  knowledge of the system, such as the Requirements, the <b>Glossary</b>, 
  and, in particular, the <b>Domain Model</b> 
  or the <b>Business Analysis Model</b>, if you have one. </p>
<p>When you define the key abstractions, also define any relationships that exist 
  between entity classes. Present the key abstractions in one or several class 
  diagrams, and create a short description for each.&nbsp;Depending on the domain, 
  and the novelty of the system, <a href="../glossary.htm#XE_analysis_pattern__definition_in_glossary"><b>analysis 
  patterns</b></a> that capture many of the key abstractions required to model 
  the system might already exist. Use of such patterns (which should already have 
  been successfully employed in the domain) will considerably ease the intellectual 
  burden of identifying the important concepts that must be represented. [<a href="../referenc.htm#FOW97a">FOW97a</a>] 
  presents some analysis patterns that are immediately useful for modeling business 
  systems, but might be applicable in other contexts. Another example is the Object 
  Management Group (OMG), which also attempts to define interfaces and protocols 
  for many domains through the work of its Domain Technology Committee and associated 
  task forces. Inevitably, this work leads to identifying important abstractions 
  in the domain.</p>
<p>The analysis classes identified at this point will probably change and evolve 
  during the course of the project. The purpose of this step is not to identify 
  a set of classes that will survive throughout design, but to identify the key 
  concepts the system must handle. Don't spend too much time describing entity 
  classes in detail at this initial stage, because there is a risk that you'll 
  identify classes and relationships not actually needed by the use cases. Remember 
  that you will find more entity classes and relationships when looking at the 
  use cases.</p>

<p>Develop a high level overview of how the software is deployed. For example, 
  determine if the system needs to accessed remotely, or has requirements that 
  suggest distribution across multiple nodes. Some sources of information to consider 
  are: </p>
<ul>
  <li>users (at locations), defined in User Profiles (in the Vision) and use cases 
    (in the Use-Case Model)</li>
   
  <li>organization of business data (in the Business Analysis Model and Design Model)</li>
   
  <li>service level requirements (in the Supplementary Specifications)</li>
  <li>constraints (in the Supplementary Specifications, such as requirements to 
    interface with legacy systems)</li>
</ul>
<p>If a non-trivial distributed system is required, then a Deployment Model can 
  be used to capture the relationship between nodes. This should include provisionally 
  assigning components and data to nodes, and indicate how users access components 
  that access data. Detailed specification of nodes and connections is deferred, 
  except where they are important for estimating or assessing viability. Existing 
  assets can be used, if appropriate assets are available. Although this is the 
  first deployment model produced in the project, and it's produced quickly and 
  at a high level, it might identify actual hardware and software products if 
  they are known, or if it's important to make these selection decisions at this 
  time.</p>
<p>Validate that the deployment model supports users (especially users at remote 
  locations if this is required) performing typical use cases while satisfying 
  nonfunctional requirements and constraints. Validate that the nodes and connections 
  are adequate to support the interactions between components on different nodes, 
  and between components and their stored data.</p>

<p>When the focus is on performing the architectural synthesis during inception, 
  this step is excluded from this activity.</p>
<p>Analysis mechanisms can be identified top-down (a priori knowledge) or bottom-up 
  (discovered as you go along). In the top-down mode, experience guides the software 
  architect to know that certain problems are present in the domain and will require 
  certain kinds of solutions. Examples of common architectural problems that might 
  be expressed as mechanisms during analysis are: persistence, transaction management, 
  fault management, messaging, and inference engines. The common aspect of all 
  of these is that each is a general capability of a broad class of systems, and 
  each provides functionality that interacts with or supports the basic application 
  functionality. The analysis mechanisms support capabilities required in the 
  basic functional requirements of the system, regardless of the platform it's 
  deployed upon or the implementation language. Analysis mechanisms also can be 
  designed and implemented in a number of different ways; generally there will 
  be more than one design mechanism corresponding to each analysis mechanism, 
  and perhaps more than one way of implementing each design mechanism.</p>
<p>The bottom-up approach is where analysis mechanisms are ultimately born&#151they 
  are created as the software architect sees, perhaps faintly at first, a common 
  theme emerging from a set of solutions to various problems. There is a need 
  to provide a way for elements in different threads to synchronize their clocks 
  and there is a need for a common way of allocating resources. Analysis mechanisms, 
  which simplify the language of analysis, emerge from these patterns.</p>
<p>Identifying an analysis mechanism means you identify that a common, perhaps 
  implicit (in that the requirements for the system imply it), subproblem exists, 
  and you name it. Initially the name might be all that exists; for example,&nbsp;the 
  software architect recognizes that the system will require a persistence mechanism.&nbsp;Ultimately, 
  this mechanism will be implemented through the collaboration of a <i>society 
  of classes</i> (see [<a href="../referenc.htm#BOO98">BOO98</a>]), some of which 
  do not deliver application functionality directly, but exist only to support 
  it. Very often these support classes are located in the middle or lower layers 
  of a layered architecture, thereby providing a common support service to all 
  application level classes.</p>
<p>If the identified subproblem is common enough, perhaps a <a href="../glossary.htm#pattern"><b>pattern</b></a> 
  exists from which the mechanism can be instantiated&#151by binding existing 
  classes and implementing new ones as required by the pattern. An analysis mechanism 
  produced this way will be abstract, and will require further refinement through 
  design and implementation.</p>

  Analysis Mechanisms</a>.</p>

<p>As Architectural Analysis concludes, review the architectural mechanisms, the 
  subsystems, packages, and classes that have been identified to ensure they're 
  complete and consistent. As the results of Architectural Analysis are preliminary 
  and relatively informal, reviews should be informal as well.  
  Scenarios or use cases can be used to validate the architectural choices 
  made at several levels&#151from the business perspective down to the specific
