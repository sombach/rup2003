<p >There is no clear consensus on what constitutes
user-centered design. However, John Gould and his colleagues at IBM developed an
approach in the 1980’s called <i>Design for Usability</i>  [<a href="../../referenc.htm#GOU88">GOU88</a>]
which encompasses most commonly-accepted definitions. It developed from
practical experience on a number of interactive systems, most notably IBM’s
1984 Olympic Messaging System [<a href="../../referenc.htm#GOU87">GOU87</a>].&nbsp; The approach has four main components as described below.</p>

<p ><span >Gould
suggests that developers should decide who the users will be and to involve them
at the earliest possible opportunity. He suggests a number of ways of becoming
familiar with users, their tasks and requirements:</span></p>

<p><span>&nbsp;In
the Rational Unified Process (RUP), </span><span >workshops are
used at several key stages, but these must be complemented by the kinds of
activities Gould describes if an accurate picture is to be formed. (Part of
the argument behind this is that people frequently describe what they do quite
differently from how they do it. Commonly performed tasks and seemingly
unimportant details such as placement of work or the existence of &quot;mysterious&quot; scraps
of paper are often forgotten, or omitted because they are not
&quot;officially&quot; part of the current process.)</span></p>
<h3><span ><a name="Integrated design">Integrated
with design</a></span><a href="#Top"><img src="../../../images/top.gif" alt="To top of page" border="0" width="26" height="20"></a></h3>
      <p ><span >Usability 
        tasks should be performed in parallel early in development. These tasks 
        would include sketching the user interface and drafting the user guides 
        or online help. Gould also makes the point that usability should be the 
        responsibility of one group.&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></p>
<p ><span >An
important feature of integrated design is that the overall approach – the
framework – for&nbsp; detailed user-interface design is developed and tested at an early stage. This is an important
difference between user-centered design and other purely incremental techniques.
It ensures that incremental design carried out in later phases fits seamlessly
into the framework and that the user interface is consistent in appearance,
terminology and concept.</span></p>
<p ><span >Within the RUP, this framework can be established by using a domain 
  model to ensure that all terminology and concepts that will appear in the user 
  interface are known and understood within the business in general and with users 
  in particular. (There will also be subsets of the domain model that will be 
  relevant only to specific groups of users. Care should be taken to ensure that 
  the domain model is organized so that these subsets can be easily identified.) 
  As user-interface design progresses, many of the domain classes will be represented 
  as user-interface elements. The user-interface elements, and the relationships 
  between them, should be consistent with the domain model and should be represented 
  consistently through all parts of the system under design. (This not only assists 
  users, but also improves reuse of user-interface components.)</span></p>
<h3><span ><a name="Early user testing">Early
user testing</a></span><a href="#Top"><img src="../../../images/top.gif" alt="To top of page" border="0" width="26" height="20"></a></h3>
<p ><span >Early user testing means early storyboarding and the early development 
  of low-fidelity prototypes. Hi-fidelity prototypes will follow later in the 
  process.</span></p>
 
<p><a href="../../artifact/ar_storyboard.htm">Storyboards</a> can be used in conjunction 
  with <a href="../../artifact/ar_uc.htm">Use Cases</a> to write concrete scenarios 
  of use for the system under design. These can take the form narrative, illustrated 
  narrative (using the user-interface mockups for illustration), Storyboards, 
  walkthroughs (with users), and user-focus groups are approaches that may be 
  unfamiliar to many software developers. However, they are clearly more cost 
  effective than the discovery of inappropriate design or misunderstood requirements 
  once implementation is under way.</p>


<h3><span ><a name="Iterative design">Iterative
design</a></span><a name="Iterative"></a><a href="#Top"><img src="../../../images/top.gif" alt="To top of page" border="0" width="26" height="20"></a></h3>
<p ><span >Object-oriented
development has become synonymous with an iterative process. Iterative design is
well-suited to problems that need a refinement of understanding and have
changing requirements. Not surprisingly, iterative design is a key component of
user-centered design. This is partly due to the changing needs of users over
time, but also the inherent complexity of producing design solutions that can
deal with diverse needs.</span></p>
<p ><span >Note
that in user-centered methods, iterative design takes place within an integrated
framework. We deliberately avoid incremental development, outside of an agreed
framework, that might lead to a &#147;patchwork&#148; solution.</span></p>

<h2><a name="Why user-centered design?">Why user-centered design?</a> <a href="#Top"><img src="../../../images/top.gif" alt="To top of page" border="0" width="26" height="20"></a></h2>
<h3><a name="Meeting user needs">Meeting user needs</a> <a href="#Top"><img src="../../../images/top.gif" alt="To top of page" border="0" width="26" height="20"></a></h3>
<p>Interactive systems rely on their ability to accommodate the needs of users
for their success. This means not only identifying diverse user communities but
also recognizing the range of skills, experience and preferences of individual
users.</p>
<p>While it is tempting for developers and managers to feel that they understand 
  user needs, this is seldom the case in practice. Attention is frequently focused 
  on how users <i>ought </i>to perform tasks rather than how they <i>prefer</i> 
  to perform them. In many cases the issue of preference is much more than simply 
  feeling in control, although that is an important issue in itself. Preference 
  will also be determined by experience, ability and the context of use. These 
  issues are considered sufficiently important to the design process to warrant 
  an international standard, [<a href="../../referenc.htm#ISO13407">ISO 13407</a>], 
  entitled <i>human-centered design processes for interactive systems</i>. The 
  standard and related issues are discussed in general terms in the remainder 
  of this paper.</p>
<h3><a name="User interface design">User-interface design</a> <a href="#Top"><img src="../../../images/top.gif" alt="To top of page" border="0" width="26" height="20"></a></h3>
<p>Users understand and interact with a system through its user interface. The
concepts, images and terminology presented in the interface must be appropriate
to users’ needs. For example, a system that allows customers to buy their own
tickets would be very different to one used professionally by ticket sales
staff. The main differences are not in the requirements or even the detailed use
cases, but the characteristics of the users and the environments in which the
systems might operate.</p>
<p>The user interface must also cater for a potentially wide range of experience
along at least two dimensions, computer and domain experience, as shown in
Figure 1 below. Computer experience includes not only general familiarity with
computers, but also experience of the system under development. Users with
little experience of either computers or the problem domain, in the near left
corner of the figure, will require a substantially different approach in the
user interface to expert users, shown here in the far right corner.</p>

<p class="picturetext"><b><font size="2">Figure 1: The effects of computer and
domain experience on ease of learning versus ease of use</font></b></p>
<p>Beware that it is not a forgone conclusion that inexperienced users will
become experts over time. A number of factors may conspire to prevent this, for
example low frequency of use, low motivation or high complexity. Conversely some
systems may have predominately expert users. Factors here might be training,
high frequency of use or high motivation (job dependence). Some of these issues
and their effects on user-interface design are shown in Table 1.</p>

Some factors affecting user-interface design</b></p>
<p>Interactive systems must either be designed to cater for an appropriate range
of user experience and circumstances, or steps must be taken to restrict the
design universe. For instance, training can be used to reduce the requirement
for ease of learning in a complex system. Alternatively a system might be
reduced in its scope in order that it better meets the core requirements of its
users (a suggestion made by Alan Cooper in his book <i>The Inmates Are Running
the Asylum </i>[<a href="../../referenc.htm#COO99">COO99</a>]).</p>

<p >As part of user-centered design, we need to consider the
skills and physical attributes of users. These issues are now being increasingly
embodied in legislation.&nbsp;This is
mostly directed at accommodating users with disabilities. However, making

user community as a whole.</p>

<p>Developing systems appropriate to user needs means a significant effort in
requirements analysis. In user-centered design, this effort is focused on end
users. These are a subset of the human <a href="../../artifact/ar_bact.htm">Business
Actors</a> (for users outside of the business) and <a href="../../artifact/ar_bwk.htm">Business
Workers</a> found when working in the <a href="../busmodel/wfd_bm.htm">Business Modeling</a>
discipline. They are later described in greater detail in the Requirements
discipline as <a href="../../artifact/ar_actor.htm">Actors</a>. (The relationships
between Actors, Business Actors and Business Workers is discussed in <a href="../../modguide/md_bmtse.htm">Guideline:
Going from Business Models to Systems</a>.)</p>
<p>However, a substantial point of emphasis in User-Centered design is that we
understand the requirements of the real people who will fill the roles described
in the artifacts mentioned above. In particular, we must avoid designing
hypothetical humans for whom it is convenient to design software systems. The
artifacts describing end users must be written only after substantial,
first-hand contact with users. In user-centered design this first-hand contact
is part of a process sometimes called <i>contextual inquiry</i>. Hugh Beyer and
Karen Holtzblatt (in their book <i>Contextual Design, </i>[<a href="../../referenc.htm#BEY98">BEY98</a>])
describe the premise of contextual inquiry as:</p>
<p>&quot;...go where the customer works, observe the customer as he or she
works, and talk to the customer about the work.&quot;</p>
<p>(Some concrete examples of this have already been listed under <a href="#Focus on users">Focus
on Users</a>.) This approach is used not only to have a better understanding of
system requirements, but also of the users themselves, their tasks and
environments. Each have their own attributes and taken together are referred to
as the context of use. They are detailed in the ISO standard for user-centered
design, described below.</p>

4, ISO user-centered
design standard contexts and their the RUP artifacts</b></font></p>
<p align="left" style="text-align:left">Each of these contexts could have a
significant impact on the design of an appropriate user interface. As a result
we are faced with a potentially large number of permutations. Even for a small
system, there may be 2 environments (e.g. office and customer site), 3 types of
user (sales novice, sales expert and management) and 6 roles (telephone sales
assistant, external sales representative, etc.). That means up to 36 potential
variations per task, although the set of realistic combinations is usually much
smaller.</p>
<p>Clearly tasks must be described individually, but a single description is
unlikely to be appropriate for all permutations. One approach is to factor the
user and environment contexts into the role description. This is the solution
adopted by Constantine and Lockwood [<a href="../../referenc.htm#CON99">CON99</a>].
It involves providing a separate &quot;user role&quot; for each significant
permutation of role, user and environment, then naming the resulting user role
with a descriptive phrase, rather that a simple noun. Compare, for example, the
role &#147;Customer&#148; with the user roles &#147;Casual Customer&#148;, &#147;Web Customer&#148;,
&#147;Regular Customer&#148; and &#147;Advanced Customer&#148;.</p>
<p>Each user role description includes details of the role itself plus its users
(referred to as role incumbents) and environment. This approach can be adopted
with the RUP by choosing actors that correspond to user roles.</p>
<h3><a name="XE_essential_use_cases__description"></a><a name="Scenarios, use cases and essential use cases">Scenarios,
use cases, and essential use cases</a> <a href="#Top"><img src="../../../images/top.gif" alt="To top of page" border="0" width="26" height="20"></a></h3>
<p>The terms scenarios, Use Cases and essential Use Cases have a confusing degree 
  of overlap and are used in different design approaches to mean slightly different 
  things. For example, within the RUP &quot;scenario&quot; means a Use-Case instance; 
  simply a specific &quot;path&quot; through the possible basic and alternative 
  flows. However, it is common to find user-centered and user-interface design 
  methods describing scenarios as stories of use, containing substantially more 
  detail than just the flow of events. While this additional information may be 
  irrelevant in later design phases, it does form part of the understanding of 
  users, tasks and environments. Consequently, scenarios may be used extensively 
  (in <a href="../../workguid/wg_stbd.htm">storyboarding</a> and 
  <a href="../../workguid/wg_rlpl.htm">role 
  playing</a>) in the Business Modeling discipline, but the focus moves towards 
  Use Cases in the Requirements discipline.</p>
<p>Figure 3 shows the nature of this overlap. The scale at the top incorporates 
  a number of different factors that <i>tend</i> to vary together. For example, 
  as purpose moves more towards requirements, structure usually becomes more formal. 
  Essential Use Cases appear to the right of generic Use Cases because user roles 
  make them slightly more specific (see the preceding section) and they have a 
  more formal structure.</p>

<p align="left">This Use Case captures the <i>essence</i> of the getting cash 
  interaction. The User Action and System Response headings have been replaced 
  by User Intention and System Responsibility to reflect the change in emphasis. 
  Good interface design centers on user goals and intentions; these are often 
  hidden in conventional Use Cases.&nbsp;&nbsp;Essential Use Cases are particularly 
  useful if:</p>
<ul>
  <li>there are few design constraints (for example, the implied design constraint of 
    using bank cards is false)</li>
  <li>the system might be enhanced to use other means of identification (such 
    as some kind of secure internet access)</li>
  <li>there is a desire to create Use Cases without design constraints, for potential 
    reuse in projects that lack these constraints.</li>
</ul>
<p align="left">However, essential Use Cases do have their drawbacks. Perfectly 
  straightforward Use Cases such as that in Table 5 can be subject to considerable 
  debate when it comes to distilling their essence. For example, does inserting 
  a card identify the customer or the account? In most existing ATMs, it is the 
  later although Constantine and Lockwood have chosen to interpret this as identifying 
  the customer. This may have been a deliberate decision in light of newer technology 
  such as retina scanning and fingerprint identification, or it may have been 
  an oversight. The consequences in this case is an additional choice that has 
  to be made by customers who hold more than one account.</p>
<p align="left">Another difficulty that essential Use Cases present is that they 
  are not as suitable for review with end users and other stakeholders because 
  of their abstract nature. Part of this problem stems from having to translate 
  essential Use Cases back to a concrete form representing user actions. This 
  can be done once a Design Model is available by writing scenarios that describe 
  the interaction in concrete terms (similar in concept to a <a href="../../artifact/ar_ucrea.htm">Use-Case 
  Realization</a>, although concerned with user-system interaction rather than 
  internal object collaboration).</p>
<p>In summary, building essential Use Cases may not a good idea if:</p>
<ul>
  <li>the user interface technologies are intentionally highly constrained (for 
    example, the system must accept bank cards)</li>
  <li>the time to required for the users to understand the more abstract Use Cases 
    is outweighed by the expected benefits.</li>
</ul>
