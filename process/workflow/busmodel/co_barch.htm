<p>We define business architecture as an organized set of elements with clear 
  relationships to one another, which together form a whole defined by its functionality. 
  The elements represent the organizational and behavioral structure of a business 
  system and show abstractions of the key processes and structures of the business 
  [<a href="../../referenc.htm#NDL97">NDL97</a>], [<a href="../../referenc.htm#ERI00">ERI00</a>].</p>
<h3><a name="Context of Business Architecture">Context of Business Architecture<img src="../../../images/top.gif" alt="To top of page" border="0" width="26" height="20"></a></h3>
<p>Different people have different backgrounds and perspectives. When attempting 
  to achieve a common understanding on something as complex as the organization—including 
  its processes, structure, and strategy—we need a way to describe architecture 
  and architecturally significant issues in a way that will be understood by each 
  impacted group. This is done by describing three different-yet-related architectures 
  as shown and described later in this document.</p>
<p align="center"><img border="0" src="images/co_barc1.gif" width="683" height="334"></p>
<p><b>Business architecture </b>is a description of the significant aspects of 
  the organization. <b>Application architecture </b>is a description of the software 
  applications that support the business, including how those applications are 
  used and how they interact with each other. <b>Technical architecture</b> is 
  a description of the hardware infrastructure that supports the software applications.</p>
<p>The business architecture must govern the application architecture, which in 
  turn must govern the technical architecture. This does not imply a hierarchical 
  relationship wherein the business architecture prescribes to the application 
  architecture, and the application architecture prescribes to technical architecture. 
  Rather, it means that goals and constraints (called drivers) are communicated 
  in one direction, and any architectural decisions (called tradeoffs) that affect 
  the governing architecture must be made at the level of the governing architecture. 
  An architectural goal implies a desired condition, while an architectural constraint 
  implies mandatory compliance. However, even constraints can be intentionally 
  ignored. For example, a constraint that requires the business to comply with 
  certain legislation might be ignored because the cost of making the changes 
  necessary to comply far exceed the penalties incurred by noncompliance.</p>
<p>Architecting<b> </b>is about balancing forces and making tradeoffs to create 
  a solution that optimally satisfies conflicting requirements. This means that 
  the business architecture defines goals and constraints that describe the support 
  that it requires from application architecture. The same applies to the application 
  and the technical architecture. Where conflicts arise, as they always do, localized 
  sub-optimal solutions must be found in order to ensure an optimum overall solution. 
  When these decisions have a broad impact, they are termed <b>architectural issues</b> 
  and must be formally agreed to by stakeholders represented by an architecture 
  board.</p>
<p>These different architectures must always be considered when communicating 
  with stakeholders. Discussing only one of them with an individual who does not 
  understand its form, application, or notation results in ineffective communication. 
  Furthermore, it can cause that individual to misunderstand the consequences 
  of his or her decisions <b> </b>regarding the other architectures. The impact 
  of decisions in one of the architectures must be translated to the other ones. 
  This helps stakeholders understand the benefits and disadvantages of tradeoffs, 
  which leads to architectural alignment. Architectural alignment helps us understand 
  the consequences of decisions.</p>
<h3><a name="Business Architecture is a Framework for Change">Business Architecture 
  as a Framework for Change<img src="../../../images/top.gif" alt="To top of page" border="0" width="26" height="20"></a></h3>
<p>The business architecture is what we use to communicate with different stakeholders 
  about the business to ensure a common, consistent understanding. We can describe 
  the business architecture as the framework within which we make changes to the 
  organization to enable the business to ultimately realize the business idea, 
  as shown in the figure.</p>

<h3><a name="Architectural Views">Business Architectural Views<img src="../../../images/top.gif" alt="To top of page" border="0" width="26" height="20"></a></h3>
<p>Because business architecture is complex and difficult to measure, we divide 
  it into a number of different views. Much as the software architecture is defined 
  in <a href="../ana_desi/co_swarch.htm">Concepts: Software Architecture</a>, 
  the architectural views of the business will be defined here. </p>
<p>Each view describes one aspect of the entire business. It therefore contains 
  an architecturally significant subset of what would be a complete definition. 
  In other words, an architectural view contains the 20% that really matters to 
  that aspect of the business [<a href="../../referenc.htm#ROY98">ROY98</a>].</p>
<p>The architectural views are helpful in discussing the business architecture 
  with different stakeholders. Because each stakeholder has one or several views 
  that are of particular interest, he or she can focus on those aspects of the 
  organization that are associated with those views without having to understand 
  everything else as well. </p>
<p>Note that not all views apply to all situations. Some views can be ignored 
  when they add no value, and sometimes it might be necessary to define new views. 
  Here are some typical business architectural views: </p>
<ul>
  <li><b>Market View</b> describes the markets in which the business operates, 
    customer profiles and offerings, or the products and services that the business 
    offers to customers in the target markets.</li>
  <li><b>Business Process View</b> describes the significant goals of the business 
    and outlines the key business use cases that support these goals.&nbsp;When 
    business use cases are used to document business processes, this view is called 
    the Business Use Case View. </li>
  <li><b>Organization View</b> describes the groupings of roles and responsibilities 
    within the business and the realization of business use cases.</li>
  <li><b>Human Resource View</b> describes remuneration profiles and incentive 
    mechanisms, key cultural characteristics and mechanisms, competence profiles, 
    and education and training mechanisms.</li>
  <li><b>Domain View</b> describes the major business concepts and information 
    structures used by the business.</li>
  <li><b>Geographic View</b> describes the distribution of organizational structure 
    and function across physical locations such as cities and countries.</li>
  <li><b>Communication View</b> describes the communication pathways within the 
    business.</li>
</ul>
