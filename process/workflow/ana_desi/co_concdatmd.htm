<p> As defined in &nbsp;[<font color="#FF0000"><a href="../../referenc.htm#NBG01">NBG01</a></font>], 
  conceptual data modeling represents the initial stage in the development of 
  the design of the persistent data and persistent data storage for the system.&nbsp;In 
  many cases, the persistent data for the system are managed by a relational database 
  management system (RDBMS). The business and system entities identified at a 
  conceptual level from the business models and system requirements will be evolved 
  through the use-case analysis, use-case design, and database design activities 
  into detailed physical table designs that will be implemented in the RDBMS.&nbsp; 
  Note that the Conceptual Data Model discussed in this concept document is not 
  a separate artifact. Instead it consists of a composite view of information 
  contained in existing Business Modeling, Requirements, and Analysis and Design 
  Disciplines artifacts that is relevant to the development 
  of the <a href="../../artifact/ar_datmd.htm">Data Model</a>.&nbsp; </p>

<p> The <a href="../../artifact/ar_datmd.htm">Data Model</a> typically evolves 
  through the following three general stages:</p>

<ul>
  <li><b>Conceptual</b>—This stage involves the identification of the high level 
    key business and system entities and their relationships that define the scope 
    of the problem to be addressed by the system. These key business and system 
    entities are defined using the modeling elements of the UML profile for business 
    modeling included in the Business Analysis Model and the <a href="../../artifact/ar_aclss.htm">Analysis 
    Class</a> model elements of the Analysis Model. </li>
  <li><b>Logical</b>—This stage involves the refinement of the conceptual high 
    level business and system entities into more detailed logical entities. These 
    logical entities and their relationships can be optionally defined in a Logical 
    Data Model using the modeling elements of the UML profile for database design 
    as described in <a href="../../modguide/md_datmd.htm">Guidelines: Data Model</a>. 
    This optional Logical Data Model is part of the <a href="../../artifact/ar_datmd.htm">Artifact: 
    Data Model</a> and not a separate RUP artifact. </li>
  <li><b>Physical</b>—This stage involves the transformation of the logical class 
    designs into detailed and optimized physical database table designs.&nbsp;The 
    physical stage also includes the mapping of the database table designs to 
    tablespaces and to the database component in the database storage design. 
  </li>
</ul>

<p> The activities related to database design span the entire software development 
  lifecycle, and the initial database design activities might start during the 
  <a href="../../itrwkfls/iwf_iii.htm">inception phase</a>.&nbsp; For projects 
  that use business modeling to describe the business context of the application, 
  database design may start at a conceptual level with the identification of Business 
  Actors and Business Use Cases in the Business Use-Case Model, and the Business 
  Workers and Business Entities in the Business Analysis Model.&nbsp; For projects 
  that do not use business modeling, the database design might start at the conceptual 
  level with the identification of System Actors and System Use Cases in the Use-Case 
  Model, and the identification of <a href="../../artifact/ar_aclss.htm">Analysis 
  Classes</a> in the <a href="../../artifact/ar_amdl.htm">Analysis Model</a> from 
  the Use-Case Realizations. </p>

<p> The figure below shows the set of Conceptual Data Model elements that reside 
  in the Business Models, Requirements Models, and the Analysis Model. </p>

<p align="center">
<img border="0" src="images/co_concdatmd1.gif" width="704" height="433"></p>

<p> The following sections describe the elements of the Business Models, Use-Case 
  Model, and Analysis Model that can be used to define the initial Conceptual 
  Data Model for persistent data in the system. </p>

<p>
<b><u>Business Use-Case Model</u></b></p>

<p> The Business Use-Case Model consists of Business Actors and Business Use Cases.&nbsp;The 
  Business Use Cases represent key business processes that are used to define 
  the context for the system to be developed.&nbsp;Business Actors represent key 
  external entities that interact with the business through the Business Use Cases.&nbsp;The 
  figure below shows a very simple example Business Use-Case Model for an online 
  auction application. </p>

<p>&nbsp;
</p>

<p align="center">
<img border="0" src="images/co_concdatmd2.gif" width="529" height="109"></p>

<p> As entities of significance to the problem of space for the system, Business 
  Actors are candidate entities for the Conceptual Data Model.&nbsp; In the example 
  above, the Buyer and Seller Business Actors are candidate entities for which 
  the online auction application must store information. </p>

<p>
<b><u>Business Analysis Model</u></b></p>

<p> The Business Analysis Model contains classes that model the Business Workers 
  and Business Entities identified from analysis of the workflow in the Business 
  Use Case. Business Workers represent the participating workers that perform 
  the actions needed to carry out that workflow.&nbsp; Business Entities are &quot;things&quot; 
  that the Business Workers use or produce during that workflow.&nbsp;In many 
  cases, the Business Entities represent types of information that the system 
  must store persistently.&nbsp; </p>

<p> The figure below shows an example sequence diagram that depicts Business Workers 
  and Business Entities from one scenario of the Business Use Case titled &quot;Provide 
  Online Auction&quot; for managing an auction.</p>

<p align="center">
<img border="0" src="images/co_concdatmd3.gif" width="624" height="465"></p>

<p> In this simplified example, the Auction Manager object represents a Business 
  Worker role that will likely be performed by the online auction management system 
  itself.&nbsp; The Auction and Auction Item objects are Business Entities that 
  are used or produced by the Auction Manager worker acting as an agent for the 
  Seller and Buyer Business Actors.&nbsp; From a database design perspective, 
  the Auction and Auction Item Business Entities are candidate entities for the 
  Conceptual Data Model.&nbsp; </p>

<a name="Requirements and Analysis Models"></a>Requirements and Analysis Models
<a href="#Top">
<img src="../../../images/top.gif"alt="To top of page" border="0" width="26" height="20"></a>
</h4>

<p> For projects that do not perform business modeling, the Requirements (System 
  Use Case) and Analysis Models contain model elements that can be used to develop 
  an initial Conceptual Data Model.&nbsp; For projects that use business modeling, 
  the business entities and relationships identified in the Business Analysis 
  Models are refined and detailed in the Analysis Model as Entity Classes.&nbsp;&nbsp; 
</p>

<p>
<u><b>System Use-Case Model</b></u></p>

<p> The System Use-Case Model contains System Actors and System Use Cases 
  that define the primary interactions of the users with the system. 
  The System Use Cases define the functional requirements for the system. </p>

<p> From a conceptual data modeling perspective, the System Actors represent entities 
  external to the system for which the system might need to store persistent information. 
  This is important in cases where the System Actor is an external system that 
  provides data to and/or receives data from the system under development.&nbsp; 
  System Actors can be derived from the Business Actors in the Business Use-Case 
  Model and the Business Workers in the Business Analysis Model.&nbsp; </p>

<p> The figure below depicts the Business Use-Case Model for the online auction 
  system.&nbsp;In this model, the Buyer and Seller Business Actors are now derived 
  from a generic User Business Actor. A new System Actor named Credit Service 
  Bureau has been added to reflect the need to process payments through an external 
  entity.&nbsp;This new System Actor is another candidate entity for the Conceptual 
  Data Model. </p>

<p>
<u><b>Analysis Model</b></u></p>

<p>The <a href="../../artifact/ar_amdl.htm">Analysis Model</a> contains the <a href="../../artifact/ar_aclss.htm">Analysis 
  Classes</a> identified in the Use-Case Realizations for the System Use Cases. The types of Analysis Classes that 
  are of primary interest from a conceptual data modeling perspective are the 
  Entity Analysis Classes. As defined in <a href="../../modguide/md_acls2.htm">Guidelines: 
  Analysis Class</a>, Entity Analysis Classes represent information managed by 
  the system that must be stored in a persistent manner.&nbsp;The Entity Analysis 
  Classes and their relationships form the basis of the initial Data Model for 
  the application.&nbsp; 
<p>The conceptual Entity Analysis Classes in the Analysis Model might be refined 
  and detailed into logical Persistent Design Classes in the Design Model.&nbsp;These 
  design classes represent candidate tables in the Data Model.&nbsp;The attributes 
  of the classes are candidate columns for the tables and also represent candidate 
  keys for them. <a href="../../modguide/md_rdbforw.htm">See Guidelines: Forward-Engineering 
  Relational Databases</a> for a description of how elements in the Design Model 
  can be mapped to Data Model elements.</p>
