<h3><a name="Introduction">Introduction</a> <a href="#Top"><img src="../../../images/top.gif" alt="To top of page" border="0" width="26" height="20"></a></h3>
<p>This page explains how to implement process and tools in a software
development project by performing the activities described in the Environment discipline. It also
discusses the Project Management discipline, which deals with planning the
project, identifying risks, and managing, monitoring, and evaluating the
project.&nbsp;</p>
<p>It's important to understand that there are different ways to implement process 
  and tools, as described in the section &quot;<a href="#Types of Software-Development Projects">Approaches 
  to Implementing Process and Tools</a>&quot;. The approach you choose depends 
  on the current state of the project and its surrounding organization, therefore, 
  do an assessment of the project and its surrounding organization.</p>
<p>The page <a href="co_envpr.htm">Concepts: Environment Practices</a> gives a
list of proven practices that help you improve process and tools on a
project.&nbsp;</p>
<p>If you want to know more about how to implement process and tools in an <b>organization</b>, 
  refer to the Process Engineering Process (PEP), a component in the <a href="../../res_processworkbench.htm">Rational 
  Process Workbench&#153; product</a>.&nbsp;</p>
<h3><a name="General Planning Guidelines">General Planning Guidelines</a> <a href="#Top"><img src="../../../images/top.gif" alt="To top of page" border="0" width="26" height="20"></a></h3>
<p>These general guidelines apply in almost every project:&nbsp;</p>
<ul>
        <li><b>Before the project starts</b>: Before the project actually starts, 
          people who act as process engineers, tool specialists, and project managers 
          must be trained in the Rational Unified Process (RUP). This is crucial to 
          the project's success. If the project members do not know what to do, 
          they probably will not succeed.</li>
  <li><b>Inception phase</b>: During this phase, you typically focus on
    understanding how to improve the way you manage requirements (Requirements
    discipline) and how you manage the project (Project Management
    discipline).&nbsp;</li>
  <li><b>Elaboration phase</b>: By the end of the Elaboration phase, all process
    and tools are in place. The most critical part of this phase is often how to
    perform configuration and change management because in the Construction
    phase, the work is performed by development teams working in parallel.</li>
  <li><b>Construction phase</b>: No new process or tools are introduced in this
    phase. The focus here is to produce the product, therefore the development
    environment must be stable. In the Construction phase, the motivation is to
    get new people on the project up-to-speed.</li>
  <li><b>Transition phase</b>: No new process or tools are introduced. In the
    Transition phase, the focus shifts from project-specific process improvement
    to project post-mortems, gathering project experiences from the current
    project, summarizing them, and packaging them in a form that future projects
    can use.&nbsp;These gathered experiences serve as input to improving process
    and tools for developing of the next evolution of the product.</li>
</ul>
<h3><a name="Types of Software-Development Projects">Approaches to Implementing
Process and Tools</a> <a href="#Top"><img src="../../../images/top.gif" alt="To top of page" border="0" width="26" height="20"></a></h3>
<p>It's important to understand the basic approaches to
implementing process and tools on a software development project. These
approaches are:&nbsp;</p>
<ul>
  <li>&quot;<a href="#Change Everything">Change everything</a>&quot;. This means
    that the project adopts the entire RUP and a complete
    set of new tools.&nbsp;</li>
  <li>&quot;<a href="#Improving Process and Tools">Improve process and tools</a>&quot;.
    This means that the project decides to improve some areas of the process and
    tools by adopting parts of the RUP and supporting
    tools.&nbsp;</li>
</ul>
<p>How much of the RUP to adopt and how many new tools you
decide to implement on a specific project depend on:</p>
<ul>
  <li>What problems are identified and prioritized for the project</li>
  <li>The capacity for change</li>
</ul>
<p align="left">These are factors you typically uncover during an assessment of 
  the project and its surrounding organization. This information is captured in 
  <a href="../../artifact/ar_deorv.htm">Artifact: Development-Organization Assessment</a>.</p>
<h4>&quot;<a name="Change Everything">Change Everything</a>&quot; (<a href="#Types of Software-Development Projects">back
to Approaches ...</a>)</h4>
<p>A project can decide to adopt the complete RUP and start
to use a new set of tools for one or several of the following reasons:&nbsp;</p>
<ul>
  <li>There is no process or tools in place and the project needs everything&#151;a
    complete process and all tools.&nbsp;</li>
  <li>All, or most, of the people are new hires and no commonly accepted way of
    working exists.&nbsp;</li>
  <li>The project will shift to a new technology for the organization, which
    means that the existing process and tools will become obsolete.&nbsp;</li>
</ul>
<p>If you decide to introduce the complete RUP and tools
onto your project, then it's important to incrementally implement the process
and tools. By implementing process and tools in a step-by-step procedure, it's
easier to manage the risks and it makes these changes less overwhelming for the
people on the project. The following diagram illustrates when the different
Environment artifacts would be developed over a project's lifecycle.&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p align="center">&nbsp;<img border="0" src="images/introduce.gif" width="522" height="321"></p>
<p class="picturetext">The evolution of the Environment artifacts in a project
where &quot;everything is new&quot;.</p>
<h5>Comments to the plan:</h5>
<ul>
  <li><b>Overall</b>: The Business Modeling discipline is&nbsp; skipped
    altogether.&nbsp;</li>
  <li><b>Inception</b>: Focus on introducing the Requirements and Project
    Management disciplines. To reduce the number of new factors, the
    user-interface parts of Requirements are not introduced. The project manager
    decides what parts of the Project Management discipline to use.&nbsp;</li>
  <li><b>Elaboration iteration E-1</b>: Analysis &amp; Design and Architecture
    are most important in the Elaboration phase. Automated Test and
    Configuration &amp; Change Management are not as crucial this early in the
    project because the number of project members is relatively low. This can be
    introduced later in the project.&nbsp;</li>
  <li><b>Elaboration iteration E-2</b>: Test tools and process are introduced to
    automate testing. Rational RequisitePro is introduced to manage the changing
    requirements.</li>
  <li><b>Elaboration iteration E-3</b>: In the Construction phase, the work will
    be performed by development teams working in parallel. Therefore, it's
    crucial to have the Configuration &amp; Change Management discipline in place
    at the end of the Elaboration phase. The deployment manager decides how to
    perform the discipline in the Deployment discipline.&nbsp;</li>
  <li><b>Construction</b>: Nothing new is introduced. From an Environment
    perspective, the focus during the Construction phase is to get all new
    people on the project up-to-speed.</li>
  <li><b>Transition</b>: Nothing new is introduced. The process and tools are
    refined as needed.</li>
</ul>
<h4>&quot;<a name="Improving Process and Tools">Improve Process and Tools</a>&quot;
(<a href="#Types of Software-Development Projects">back to Approaches ...</a>)</h4>
<p>The people on a project in an organization where a process and tools are in
place, have the capability to develop a system. These people have a common way
of working, which is a process that may be more, or less, well
documented.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>The long-term goal may be to adopt the complete RUP and
a complete set of new tools. However, the short-term goal is to improve on one
or several areas of the process and tool support. These should be areas that
have high improvement potential.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The diagram below shows an example of a project that has decided to adopt the
Requirements discipline along with tools, such as RequisitePro and Rational Rose, to
improve the way requirements are managed. The project has also decided to
introduce the Analysis &amp; Design discipline.&nbsp;</p>
<p align="center"><img border="0" src="images/improve.gif" width="522" height="239"></p>
<p align="center" class="picturetext">The evolution of the Environment artifacts
when improving Requirements and Analysis &amp; Design.&nbsp;</p>
<p>It's important to understand that the diagram above is only an example. The
parts of the process you decide to improve on will differ between projects,
depending on the problems and needs of a particular project. You must assess the
project and its surrounding organization to find out those parts of the process
you want to improve or which tools you want to introduce.</p>
