<p>Usability testing evaluates the system from the perspective of the end user and 
includes the following types of tests: 
<ul>
  <li>human factors (see <a href="../requirem/co_ucd.htm">Concepts: User-Centered 
    Design</a>) 
  <li>esthetics 
  <li>consistency in the user interface (see <a href="../../modguide/md_uig.htm">Guidelines: 
    User-Interface</a>) 
  <li>online and context-sensitive help
  <li>wizards and agents
  <li>user documentation&nbsp; 
  <li>training materials</li>
  </ul>
  
<p>Usability testing is not a substitute for good design&#151;it's most effective 
  when combined with User-Centered Design (see <a href="../requirem/co_ucd.htm">Concepts: 
  User-Centered Design</a>).</p>
  
<p>Start usability testing early.&nbsp;<span lang="EN-US" style="mso-ansi-language: EN-US">Early 
  user testing means early prototyping, typically drawings and mockups described 
  as low-fidelity prototypes. The hi-fidelity prototypes follow later in the process 
  (see <a href="../../activity/ac_uip.htm">Activity: Prototype the User Interface</a>).</span></p>

<h3><b><a name="How to Expose the Design">Ways of Exposing the Design</a> </b><a href="#Top"><img src="../../../images/top.gif" alt="To top of page" border="0" width="26" height="20"></a></h3>
  
<p>One way of exposing a user-interface design is to have a business or system 
  analyst sit with the end user in front of the interface. Walk through a common 
  scenario; for example, a use case's basic flow with typical values you described 
  in a use-case storyboard. Encourage the person to ask questions and give comments.</p>
  
<p>The challenge with this approach is to ensure the information you obtain is 
  as unbiased as possible. To do this, you need to make sure the questions you 
  ask are context-free. Take as many notes as you can. If possible, have someone 
  else do this so you don't interrupt the user's natural flow. (For useful guidelines 
  on conducting user interviews and workshops, see Guidelines: <a href="../../workguid/wg_intrv.htm">interviews</a> 
  and <a href="../../workguid/wg_rqwsh.htm">requirements workshops</a>.)</p>
  
<p>Another way of exposing the user-interface design is to perform use tests. 
  These are often conducted as a lab or workshop with representatives from the 
  end-user community. In a use test, real users perform real tasks with the interface, 
  and the software development staff typically takes a passive, observational 
  role. 
<p>A lot of value can be gained from this type of usability testing, however, 
  there are a number of challenges that must be faced and tradeoffs that must 
  be made to get reliable, economic results: 
<ul>
  <li>As a general rule, this approach has the most value if the end-user community 
    is large, varied, and has a great degree of control over selecting their software 
    system. In the presence of these factors, the risk of not performing use tests 
    increases. Often the greater the value in performing these tests, the harder 
    it is to gain access to, coordinate, and manage this activity with the end 
    user.&nbsp; 
  <li>It's important to identify the most common usage patterns, discounting outlier 
    and exceptional results, to ensure that the user-interface design decisions 
    are based on the needs of the majority. To do this, you need both broad and 
    deep sample data, which usually requires a large amount of gathering and collating 
    effort.</li>
  <li>Where end users must migrate from an existing legacy system to a new system, 
    they are often concerned that the new system will provide less functionality 
    than that provided by the old one. Unfortunately, this issue is seldom raised 
    directly, and is often concealed by comments such as &quot;I want the new 
    system to look and feel exactly the way the existing system does&quot;.</li>
  <li>&nbsp;Where a significant change in technology is being proposed to an end-user 
    community, it may be necessary to provide training in the basic use of the 
    technology before significant value will be gained from use testing. For example, 
    legacy system users may have had no previous experience using a mouse or working 
    with a GUI.</li>
</ul>
  
<p>Each project team needs to consider these challenges against the unique project 
  environment they are working within to arrive at the appropriate timing, method, 
  and approach to usability testing.</p>
  
<h3><b><a name="Benefits of Exposing the Design to Various Stakeholders">Benefits of Exposing the Design to Various 
  Stakeholders</a> </b><a href="#Top"><img src="../../../images/top.gif" alt="To top of page" border="0" width="26" height="20"></a></h3>
  
<p>It's very important to expose the user interface to others. As the design and 
  implementation of the interface progresses, you expose the design to increasing 
  numbers of reviewers, including: </p>
  <ul>
    <li>other project members 
    <li>external usability experts 
    <li>users</li>
  </ul>
  
<p>To get valuable feedback, you don't always have to go through formal use tests 
  where real users perform real tasks. An important class of user-interface defects 
  are caused by the <i>home blindness</i> of the user-interface designer&#151;anyone 
  who wasn't involved in the user-interface design should be able to identify 
  most of these defects.</p>
  
<h4><b><a name="Exposing the Design to Other Project Members">Other Project Members</a> 
  </b><a href="#Top"><img src="../../../images/top.gif" alt="To top of page" border="0" width="26" height="20"></a></h4>
  
<p>This is an underestimated way of exposing the design. It has a very fast turnaround 
  time: project members are already familiar with the application and usually 
  they're available for a spontaneous usability session without tremendous ceremony 
  or formality. User-interface designers should do this continuously during the 
  design activity to cure their own <i>home blindness</i>.</p>
  
<h4><b><a name="Exposing the Design to External Usability Experts">External Usability 
  Experts</a> </b><a href="#Top"><img src="../../../images/top.gif" alt="To top of page" border="0" width="26" height="20"></a></h4>
  
<p>A good usability expert can help to reduce development effort by pointing out 
  common usability flaws, and usually offers other perspectives on the user interface 
  based on experience. It can be valuable to involve external usability experts 
  early in the user-interface design work, so there's sufficient time to refactor 
  the design to incorporate their recommendations.</p>
  
<h4><b><a name="Exposing the Design to Users">Design to Users</a> </b><a href="#Top"><img src="../../../images/top.gif" alt="To top of page" border="0" width="26" height="20"></a></h4>
  
<p>Exposing prototypes to users is generally a good use of your time. Because 
  access to users is often limited, it's worth getting feedback on prototypes 
  when the opportunity arises. Do this as often as necessary to gain the stakeholders' 
  approval and to correct any misinterpretation of the stakeholders' needs. This 
  can occur either during requirements capture or user-interface design. Wherever 
  possible, avoid exposing the same user to the interface more than once&#151;the 
  second time, the user will be tainted by your earlier design ideas (similar 
  to <i>home blindness</i>), and, as such, the value of the activity is diminished.</p>
  
<p>Also, when you expose a software prototype to end users, be careful to set 
  the expectations correctly. If you don't, users may have expectations that they'll 
  experience the full behavior of the functioning system behind the user interface.</p>
