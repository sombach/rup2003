<h2 class="banner"><rpw name="PresentationName">Sample Iteration Plan</rpw>: Construction Phase</h2>
<p>This illustration shows the relationship of the workflows in an early construction 
  iteration of a project following the <b>Classic RUP configuration</b> or similar. 
  It is constructed from the Workflow Details as they would appear at that time. 
  The intent is to indicate dependencies and show where workflows occur in parallel. 
  The lengths of the bars in the chart (indicating duration) have no absolute 
  significance. For example, it is not intended to convey that Plan the Integration 
  and Plan Test must have the same duration. There is also no intention to suggest 
  the application of a uniform level of effort across the duration of the workflows. 
  An indication of the relative effort can be seen in the<a href="../ovu_proc.htm"> 
  Process Overview</a>. You can navigate to the corresponding Workflow Detail 
  pages from each line of the chart by clicking on the Workflow Detail name. This 
  illustration was created from a <a href="../../prjtmpl/mgmt/mp_conit.htm">Microsoft 
  Project Plan</a>.</p>
<p>
Note that there is significant continuing design work shown in this iteration,
indicating that it is early in the construction cycle. In later construction
iterations, this will diminish as design work completes, when the design work
remaining will relate to Change Requests (defects and enhancements) that impact
design. Requirements discovery and refinement is shown as complete at this
stage, the remaining effort relating entirely to the management of change.</p>

        (see <a href="../artifact/ar_itpln.htm">Artifact: Iteration Plan</a>). 
        Productivity figures, size of code, and size of database might be interesting

        <p>The project manager, in cooperation with the process engineer and the

<h4>Result</h4>
<p>The main result of a late iteration in the construction phase is that more
functionality is added, which yields an increasingly more complete system. The
results of the current iteration are made visible to developers to form the
basis of development for the subsequent iteration.</p>
