<p>The following decisions should be made regarding the Analysis &amp; Design

discipline's workflow:</p>

<ul>

  <li>Decide how to perform the workflow by looking at the <a href="../workflow/ana_desi/wfd_and.htm">Analysis 

    &amp; Design: Workflow</a>. Study the diagram with its <a href="../glossary.htm#guard_condition"><i>guard 

    conditions</i></a>, and the guidelines. Decide which workflow details to perform 

    and in which order.&nbsp;</li>

  <li>Decide what parts of the Analysis &amp; Design workflow details to perform. The

    following parts can be introduced relatively independently from the rest.</li>

</ul>

<ul>

  <li>Decide when, during the project lifecycle, to introduce each part of the

    workflow. It is sometimes possible to wait until the Elaboration phase

    before introducing the Analysis &amp; Design discipline. For example, if the

    development is in a well-understood domain, does not have demanding

    performance (or other non-functional) requirements, and will be based on a

    well-tried architecture, there is little need for prototyping during

    inception.</li>

</ul>

<p>Document the decisions in 
the Development Case, under the headings <i>Disciplines, Analysis &amp; Design, Workflow</i>
.</p>

<h3><a name="Decide How to Use Artifacts">Decide How to Use Artifacts</a> <a href="#Top"><img src="../../images/top.gif" alt="To top of page" border="0" width="26" height="20"></a></h3>

<p>Make a decision about what artifacts to use and how to use each of them. The

table below describes mandatory artifacts and those artifacts used only in

certain cases. For more detailed information on how to tailor each artifact, and

a discussion of the advantages and disadvantages of that specific artifact, read

the section titled &quot;Tailoring&quot; for each artifact.</p>

<p>For each artifact, decide how the artifact should be used: Must, Should,

Could or Won't. For more details, see the <a href="md_uclaar.htm">Guidelines:

Classifying Artifacts</a>.</p>

<p>Tailor each artifact to fit the needs of the project. For tailoring considerations, 
  see the tailoring section of the artifacts' description page, 
  or the steps described under the heading &quot;Tailor Artifacts per Discipline&quot; 
  in the <a href="../activity/ac_devca.htm">Activity: Develop Development Case</a>.</p>





<h3><a name="Decide Which Reports to Use">Decide Which Reports to Use</a> <a href="#Top"><img src="../../images/top.gif" alt="To top of page" border="0" width="26" height="20"></a></h3>

<p>The decision of which reports to use will depend on the reporting tools available 
  to the project. If report generation tools are available, we recommend generating 
  reports for model oriented artifacts Decide how to review and approve the results of Analysis &amp; Design, and to

what extent the results will be reviewed.</p>

<p>The advantages of a design review are:</p>

<ul>

  <li>It detects problems that are impossible, or very difficult, to detect in

    testing. For example, issues of style, and layout.&nbsp;</li>

  <li>It is a way to enforce a common modeling style and an opportunity for

    individuals to learn from each other.&nbsp;</li>

  <li>It detects those defects that wouldn't otherwise get detected until later

    in the project during tests.</li>

</ul>

<p>The disadvantages of a design review are:</p>

<ul>

  <li>It takes time and resources.&nbsp;</li>

  <li>It is easily misused if not managed well.</li>

</ul>

<p>The factors that can be altered are review techniques, resources, and scope.

The following are some examples of what you can decide to do on your project:

<ul>

  <li>Decide that local changes to a subsystem are reviewed only by one peer,

    who conducts an inspection and hands over the results on paper.</li>

  <li>Decide on which parts of the design will not be reviewed at all; for

    example, review only some classes for each member of the project and hope

    that this assures the style is of a similar quality to the rest of the

    results.</li>

  <li>Decide that the Software Architecture Document will be reviewed by

    customer during a separate meeting.</li>

  <li>Decide to use formal review meetings for changes in important interfaces;

    that is, interfaces that affect the work of several project members.</li>

</ul>

<p>For more information about reviewing and different kinds of reviews, see <a href="../workguid/wg_rview.htm">Work

Guideline: Reviews</a>.

<h3><a name="Decide Whether to Generate Code">Decide Whether to Generate Code</a>

<a href="#Top"><img src="../../images/top.gif" alt="To top of page" border="0" width="26" height="20"></a></h3>

<p>The way you do design differs depending on whether you generate code from the

design model or not. If you generate code, the design needs to be very detailed.

On the other hand, if you do not generate code from the design, there is no need

to be very detailed in the design. On the contrary, the details in the design

have to be synchronized manually with the code.</p>
