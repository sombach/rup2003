<h3><a name="General">General</a> <a href="#Top"><img src="../../images/top.gif" alt="To top of page" border="0" width="26" height="20"></a></h3>
<p>As you sort through the many artifacts, activities, and roles in the Rational 
  Unified Process (RUP), you may ask yourself these questions:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Do I need this one?</li>
  <li>How do I sort through all of these items to determine which ones I need 
    for my project?</li>
  <li>Isn’t it obvious that the RUP is only for big projects?</li>
</ul>
<p>The topic of tailoring addresses all of these questions.</p>
<p>A software project's purpose is to produce a product. A good process enables 
  the project to produce a product that meets the needs of its stakeholders, on 
  time and within budget. For 
  additional information, see artifact: <a href="../artifact/ar_pduct.htm">Product</a>.</p>
<p>The key to a good process is in tailoring it to be as simple as possible, following 
  a <a href="../../manuals/intro/im_bp.htm">best practices</a> approach.</p>
<p>The guidelines included here should be considered for tailoring a process. 
  More detailed guidelines are provided in <a href="../workflow/environm/co_polpr.htm">Concepts: 
  RUP Tailoring</a> and in <a href="../activity/ac_tlrprjprc.htm">Activity: Tailor 
  the Process for the Project.</a>.</p>


<h3><a name="BuildAFrameworkFirst">Build a Framework First</a> <a href="#Top"><img src="../../images/top.gif" alt="To top of page" border="0" width="26" height="20"></a></h3>
<p>A common problem for many projects is that they often focus heavily in one 
  particular area, to the extent that they get bogged down with the details of 
  that particular area before making sure that they have a good idea of what &quot;key&quot; 
  elements are involved in the whole process lifecycle of producing a quality 
  product.</p> 
<p>It's usually better to address all key elements of a process in a lightweight 
  manner before focusing heavily on any one particular problem area.</p>
<p>Once the framework for a quality software process is in place, a project can 
  effectively focus on a particular area that has been identified as a major contributor 
  to their problems.&nbsp;This selection is based on identifying and prioritizing 
  risks to the project, and determining early mitigation strategies for those 
  identified risks.</p>

<h4>Do not include activities and artifacts that cannot be clearly justified</h4>
<p>The well-intentioned project manager or process engineer may have a large wish 
  list of nice-to-have metrics, controls, reports, and so on. However, activities 
  and artifacts cost time and money. Some of these costs, such as daily interaction 
  with the environment toolset, may or may not be visible, but simply get folded 
  into lower productivity on standard tasks.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>You must distinguish critical process needs from the wish list and determine 
  whether the benefits outweigh the cost.</p>

<h4>Shield your developers from the process</h4>
<p>You probably have highly trained staff with valuable skills in designing, implementing, 
  and testing. Don't have them spend hours each week filling out forms, enhancing 
  documentation, or fighting with unwieldy tools. If these activities are required, 
  consider having them done by qualified support staff.</p>

<h4>Minimize formal intermediate artifacts</h4>
<p>The format of intermediate artifacts&#151those artifacts not intended for the 
  final product&#151is not as important as the activity and thought needed to 
  produce them. It doesn't matter what they look like, or what tools you use to 
  build them, provided they serve their purpose. As Dwight D. Eisenhower said, 
  &#147;The plan is nothing; the planning is everything.&#148;</p>
<p>One trap that's easy to fall into is formalizing artifacts far too soon.&nbsp; 
  Early versions of artifacts often evolve quickly and remain fluid for some time 
  as different representations while their implications are explored. Formal documentation 
  can impede this process; you can waste a lot of time polishing an artifact that's 
  largely expendable. Hand-drawn diagrams and simple descriptions on index cards 
  are often sufficient in the early stages of an artifact and, for some projects, 
  may be all that's required.</p>


<h3><a name="UseConvenientFormats">Use Convenient Formats</a> <a href="#Top"><img src="../../images/top.gif" alt="To top of page" border="0" width="26" height="20"></a></h3>
<p>An artifact may be tailored so it can be maintained in any form. For example, 
  the Vision document may be captured as a Web page, the Project Plan may be captured 
  as a Microsoft Project file, and the Risk List may be captured as a Rational 
  RequisitePro requirement type.</p>

<h4>Generate when possible</h4>
<p>Some projects spend a lot of time populating templates of formal documents 
  by manually cutting and pasting information.&nbsp;Instead, consider generating 
  required documents from the source, using tools such as Rational SoDA, or negotiate 
  a simpler way of providing the same information, such as using Rational Rose 
  Publisher to generate a Web-based design model.</p>
<p>In many cases, you can skip an artifact altogether because the information 
  is implicitly provided in the environment. For example, rather than generate 
  the section of the Requirements Management Plan that lists attributes of requirements 
  types, you may want to only provide the tailored Rational RequisitePro project 
  with the applicable requirements types and traceability, and then walk through 
  it with the interested parties. Another example is to provide a read-only version 
  of the Microsoft Project files to the interested parties, rather than duplicating 
  graphics into a separate Software Development Plan.</p>

<h4>Use the Web</h4>
<p>A useful artifact is one that communicates valuable information.&nbsp; This 
  information should be at the fingertips of those who need it. Web technology 
  is an excellent mechanism for this purpose. If the requirements, design, and 
  implementation are available on the Web, there's no need to generate large sets 
  of quickly obsolesced paper documentation.</p>

<h4>Use integrated tools</h4>
<p>Select tools that fit the process and tailor the process to fit the tools. 
  The desired results are an easy-to-use process and toolset.&nbsp; Integrated 
  tools generally provide greater consistency, and more informative metrics and 
  reports than tools that are not integrated.</p>


<h3><a name="RevisitTheProcess">Regularly Revisit the Process</a> <a name="revisit the process" href="#Top"><img src="../../images/top.gif" alt="To top of page" border="0" width="26" height="20"></a></h3>
<p>Regularly revisit the process to refine and reduce its complexity. If your 
  staff isn't convinced that each step in the process provides added value for 
  the end product, then the process is probably broken.</p>

<h4>Tailor while retaining best practices</h4>
<p>The RUP encourages tailoring. However, tailoring is not a license to bypass 
  the process altogether.&nbsp; The essentials of the RUP are embodied in its 
  best practices. Follow the spirit of these best practices when tailoring the 
  activities and artifacts to fit your needs.</p>
