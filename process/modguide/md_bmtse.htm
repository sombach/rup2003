<p>The approach to business modeling presented in the Rational Unified Process
includes a concise and straightforward way to generate requirements for supporting
business tools or systems. A good understanding of business processes is
important for building the right systems. Even more value is added if you use people's roles and responsibilities, as well as definitions of what
&quot;things&quot; are handled by the business as a basis for building the
system. It’s from this more internal view of the business, captured in a
business analysis model, that you can see the tightest link to what the models of
the system needs to look like.</p>

Models and System Architecture</a> <a href="#Top"><img src="../../images/top.gif" alt="To top of page" border="0" width="26" height="20"></a></h3>
<p>From an architectural perspective, having business models in place is
particularly useful if your intent is to build one of the following kinds of
systems:
<ul>
  <li>Customized systems for one or more companies in a particular type of
    industry, such as banks and insurance companies.</li>
  <li>A family of applications for the open market, such as order handling systems,
    billing systems, and air-traffic control systems.</li>
</ul>
<p>The business models give input to the use-case view and the logical
view as presented in the analysis model. You can also find key
mechanisms at the analysis level, which are referred to as analysis mechanisms.</p>
<p>The following should be considered:
<ul>
  <li>For each business use case that will be supported by the system, identify
    a subsystem in the analysis model. This subsystem is in the application
    layer and is considered a first prototype iteration. For example, if
    you have an Order process and a Billing process in your business use-case
    model, identify an Order subsystem and a Billing subsystem in the
    application layer of your analysis model. You may argue that Order
    and Billing are separate systems. Well, that’s a matter of scope. If <span style="font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;
font-family:&quot;Times New Roman&quot;;mso-fareast-font-family:&quot;Times New Roman&quot;;
mso-bidi-font-family:&quot;Times New Roman&quot;;mso-ansi-language:EN-US;mso-fareast-language:
EN-US;mso-bidi-language:AR-SA">you’re</span> considering all of your business
    tools as one system with
    several applications that share architecture, Order and Billing would be
    application subsystems. If your scope is to build an Order Management
    application only, then Order Management would be your system and the
    recommendation above would not make sense. It only makes sense if your scope is such that you consider all
    business tools in your organization as one system.</li>
  <li>For each business worker supported by the system, identify
    use cases that represent what is to be automated.</li>
  <li>For each business entity supported by the system, identify
    entity classes in the analysis model. Some of these are candidates for being
    considered as key mechanisms, the component entities, in the system.</li>
  <li>For clusters of business entities—a group of business
    entities that are used solely within one business use case or a group of
    otherwise closely related business entities—create a subsystem in the
    business specific layer.</li>
</ul>

<p class="picturetext">For each business worker, identify a candidate system
actor. For each business use case the business actor participates in, create a
candidate system use case.</p>
<p>To identify information-system use cases, begin with the business workers in
the
business analysis model. For each business worker, perform the following
steps:
<ul>
  <li>Decide if the business worker will use the information system.</li>
  <li>If so, identify an actor for the information system in the information
    system’s use-case model. Give the actor the same name as the business
    worker.</li>
  <li>For each business use case in which the business worker participates, create a
    system use case.</li>
  <li>Repeat these steps for all business workers.</li>
</ul>

<p>If you are aiming at building a system that completely automates a set of business
processes—which is the case if you are building an
e-commerce application—for example, it’s no longer the business worker who will become the
system actor. Instead, it’s the business actor who will directly communicate
with the system and act as a system actor.</p>
<p>You are, in effect, changing the way business is performed when building an
application of this kind. Responsibilities of the business worker will be moved
to the business actor.</p>
<p class="exampleheading">Example:</p>
<p class="example">When building an e-commerce site for a bank, you will be
modifying the way the process is realized.
<ul>
  <li>
    <p class="example">Responsibilities of the Clerk will be moved to the
    Customer.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p class="example">Create a system actor Customer corresponding to the
    business actor Customer.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p class="example">Remove the system actor Clerk.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p class="example">Modify the system use case Money Transaction 1 to work
    with the system actor Customer, instead of Clerk.</p>
  </li>
</ul>

Models and Entity Classes in the Analysis Model</a> <a href="#Top"><img src="../../images/top.gif" alt="To top of page" border="0" width="26" height="20"></a></h3>

<p class="picturetext">For each business entity, create a class in the system's analysis
model</p>
<p>A business entity to be managed by an information system will
correspond to an entity in the analysis model of the information system. In some
cases, however, it might be suitable to let attributes of the business entity
correspond to entities in the information-system model. Several business workers
can access a business entity. Consequently, the corresponding entities
in the system can participate in several information-system use cases.</p>
<p class="exampleheading">Example:</p>
<p align="center"><img src="images/bmtosex3.gif" width="451" height="463"></p>
<p class="picturetext">The business entities Customer Profile, Account, and Loan

Events</a> <a href="#Top"><img src="../../images/top.gif" alt="To top of page" border="0" width="26" height="20"></a></h3>
<p>Business events identify important occurrences or changes of state in the
business. They are used to decouple business use cases and send notifications or
triggers about the occurrence or change in state. As such, they are an excellent
source for business process automation, to reduce interactions between business
workers and speed up business use cases. Automating business events allows for
the rapid propagation of important information throughout the business, without
burdening business workers with this responsibility.</p>
<h5>Example:</h5>
<p class="example">For example, all units involved in a military operation, may
need to be notified immediately in the event of a strategic vantage point being
claimed by friendly (or hostile) forces. Without automation, this business may
be implemented by broadcasting a codeword (such as <b>Top Hat</b>) on a specific
radio frequency. It would be left up to all receivers of the codeword to take
the necessary action (such as proceeding into the next phase of battle).
Automating this business event would allow for more efficient notification of
the event, as well as possibly automating the different responses to the event
as well.</p>

between Business Workers Translated to System Requirements</a> <a href="#Top"><img src="../../images/top.gif" alt="To top of page" border="0" width="26" height="20"></a></h3>
<p>How should you interpret a link between workers in the business model? You
must find out how the information systems can support the communicating workers.
An information system can eliminate the need to transport information between
workers by making the information available in the information system.</p>
<h3><a name="XE_entity_class__business_models¸_relationships_to"></a><a name="Using the Business Object Model for Resource Planning">Using
the Business Analysis Model for Resource Planning</a> <a href="#Top"><img src="../../images/top.gif" alt="To top of page" border="0" width="26" height="20"></a></h3>
<p>If you intend to use the
business analysis model for resource planning or as a
basis for simulation, you will need to update it to reflect what types of resources
are used. You need to modify it so that each business worker and business entity is
implemented by only one type of resource. If your aim is to re-engineer the
business process, in the first iteration of your
business analysis model, you
should not consider resources. Doing so tends to make you focus on the already existing
solutions, rather than on identifying problems that can be solved with new kinds of
solutions. Here's an example of a procedure to consider:
<ul>
  <li>In a first iteration of the
business analysis model, work without
    considering the resources or the systems that will be used to implement the
    business.</li>
  <li>Discuss what can be automated.</li>
  <li>Discuss how automation can change the business process and start sketching
    out a system use-case model and system requirements.</li>
  <li>In a second iteration to the
business analysis model, update it to reflect
    resources used and what is to be automated.
    <ul>
      <li>Some business workers will be tagged as automated workers.</li>
      <li>Some business workers will be split into two—one automated, the
        other one
        not.</li>
      <li>Parts of two business workers may be partitioned out to a new
        automated worker.</li>
      <li>Parts of a business <span style="font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;
font-family:&quot;Times New Roman&quot;;mso-fareast-font-family:&quot;Times New Roman&quot;;
mso-bidi-font-family:&quot;Times New Roman&quot;;mso-ansi-language:EN-US;mso-fareast-language:
EN-US;mso-bidi-language:AR-SA">worker’s responsibility </span>may be moved outside
        of the organization to become the responsibility of a business actor.</li>
    </ul>
    <p class="exampleheading">Example:</p>
  </li>
</ul>
<p class="example">In the banking example, we decided to update the
business analysis model in order to use it for resource planning.</p>
<ul>
  <li>
    <p class="example">The Clerk business worker is completely automated and
    becomes an Automated Clerk. The bank will only do on-line banking.</li>
  <li>
    <p class="example">The Loan Specialist is partly automated, and is split into
    an Automated Loan
      Specialist and a Loan Specialist.</li>
