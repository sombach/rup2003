<h3><a name="References">References</a></h3>
<p>The References section of the Business Architecture Document presents external 
  documents that provide background information important to understanding the 
  business architecture. If there are a large number of references, structure 
  the section in subsections, for example: 
<ul>
  <li>external documents</li>
  <li>internal documents</li>
  <li>government documents</li>
  <li>nongovernment documents</li>
</ul>
<h3><a name="Architectural Drivers">Architectural Drivers<img src="../../images/top.gif" alt="To top of page" border="0" width="26" height="20"></a></h3>
<p>The business architecture is formed by considering what is needed to optimally 
  improve, or re-engineer, the key business processes. These processes are represented 
  by business use cases, that form a subset of the <a href="../artifact/ar_bucm.htm">Business 
  Use Case Model</a>. Another important input is the business goals, also captured 
  in the <a href="../artifact/ar_bucm.htm">Business Use Case Model</a>. It is 
  not necessary to describe <i>all</i> the business goals here—only the architecturally 
  significant ones. The following are examples of characteristics that may determine 
  whether or not a business goal is architecturally significant:</p>
<ul>
  <li>It is critical for the long-term success of the enterprise.</li>
  <li>It contributes heavily to the business strategy.</li>
  <li>It cannot be realized with current process, resources, and infrastructure.</li>
  <li>Changing it would have sweeping effects on the business.</li>
  <li>It is influenced by external parties over which the business has no direct 
    control.</li>
</ul>
<p>However, these are not the only influences that shape the business architecture. 
  There also will be constraints imposed by the environment in which the business 
  must operate, by the need to reuse existing assets, by the imposition of various 
  standards, and so on. These macro-level forces (<b>drivers</b>) are said to 
  shape the business architecture because they have significant influence on what 
  the business does and the way in which it operates.</p>
<p><b>Architectural drivers </b>is the collective name for architectural <b>goals 
  </b>and <b>constraints</b>. An architectural goal describes a desire or intent 
  of the business architecture, while an architectural constraint imposes a restriction. 
  Clearly defining architectural goals enables the business to take advantage 
  of the forces affecting the business; clearly defining architectural constraints 
  reduces risk by restricting alternatives. Consider, for example, the strategic 
  focus (operational excellence, customer intimacy, or product innovation), the 
  availability of human or other resources, current and expected economic conditions, 
  technology trends, changing customer behavior, competitor movements, the state 
  of the markets in which the business operates, globalization, economic migration, 
  and legislation and regulation.</p>
<p>Also consider key quality dimensions of the business that shape
the business architecture. The information presented may include:
<ul>
  <li>operating performance requirements&nbsp;</li>
  <li>quality targets, such as &quot;all shipments delivered on-time&quot;</li>
  <li>extensibility targets, such as ability to meet growing customer demands</li>
  <li>portability targets, such as supported countries, languages, and product 
    lines</li>
</ul>
<h3><a name="The Business Process View">The Business Process View</a> <a href="#Top"><img src="../../images/top.gif" alt="To top of page" border="0" width="26" height="20"></a></h3>
<p>The Business Process View, which includes the key business processes, is a 
  subset of the <a href="../artifact/ar_bucm.htm">Artifact: Business Use Case 
  Model</a>. It describes the set of business scenarios and business use cases 
  that:</p>
<ul>
  <li>represent some significant, central capability of the business&nbsp;</li>
  <li>have a substantial coverage, meaning that that they exercise many key elements 
    of the organization&nbsp;</li>
  <li>stress or illustrate a specific, delicate, complex, or risky point of the 
    business architecture</li>
</ul>
<p>The United States General Accounting Office [<a href="../referenc.htm#GAO97">GAO97</a>] lists some criteria for
prioritizing business process:</p>
<ul>
  <li>processes with the strongest link to business strategy 
  <li>process that have the highest impact on customers 
  <li>processes with the biggest potential return on improvement 
  <li>processes for which there is strong consensus on the need for change 
  <li>processes that can be redesigned with the currently available resources 
    and infrastructure 
  <li>less-complex processes that can be improved quickly (quick wins) 
  <li>less-complex processes that can be used to gain experience in re-engineering</li>
</ul>
<p>For each significant business use case, include a subsection containing the 
  following information: 
<ul>
  <li>the name of the Business use case</li>
  <li>a brief description of the business use case, including its purpose</li>
  <li>a description of <i>why</i> the Business use case is considered architecturally 
    significant</li>
</ul>
<h3><a name="The Organization Structure View">The Organization View</a>
<a href="#Top"><img src="../../images/top.gif" alt="To top of page" border="0" width="26" height="20"></a></h3>
<p>The Organization View is a subset of the <a href="../artifact/ar_bom.htm">Artifact: 
  Business Analysis Model</a>, including elements that are significant to the 
  business architecture. It describes the most important business workers, business 
  entities and business events, their grouping into business systems, and the 
  organization of these into layers. It also includes the most important business 
  use-case realizations and descriptions of general patterns of behavior.</p>
<p>The scope of this view can be the business itself (the internal organization) 
  or the business and its relationship to its partners (the extended organization).&nbsp; 
  This last viewpoint is particularly interesting if you want to consider the 
  entire value chain involved in delivering products and services to customers.</p>
<h3><a name="Human Resources Aspects View">The Human Resource View</a> <a href="#Top"><img src="../../images/top.gif" alt="To top of page" border="0" width="26" height="20"></a>&nbsp;</h3>
<p>The Human Resource Aspects view covers all aspects of preparing an organization 
  for change. The results include:</p>
<ul>
  <li>a recommended infrastructure 
  <li>mechanisms for motivating employees to work in the changed organization</li>
  <li>mechanisms for encouraging the necessary skills in the changed organization</li>
</ul>
<p>In order to quickly arrive at a well-functioning organization, this work can 
  be started long before the final business design has been found. Early in a 
  project, in the initial iterations before the objectives for the effort are 
  stable, the work focuses on generally preparing the staff for change. Later 
  in the project, the work instead focuses on educating the employees in their 
  new tasks and investigating the needs for infrastructure changes; for example, 
  where people are located and what equipment they need. If the business-modeling 
  effort results in massive changes, such as in <a href="../glossary.htm#business_reengineering">business 
  re-engineering</a>, preparing for change might be such a complex and costly 
  task that it is treated as a separate project.</p>
<p>Kotter's change model [<a href="../referenc.htm#KOT96">KOT96</a>], which has 
  been successfully used by a number of organizations, defines the following steps 
  for leading an organization through change:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Establish a sense of urgency.</li>
  <li>Create a guiding coalition.</li>
  <li>Develop a vision and strategy.</li>
  <li>Communicate the vision.</li>
  <li>Empower broad-based action.</li>
  <li>Generate quick wins.</li>
  <li>Consolidate gains and produce more change.</li>
  <li>Institutionalize new approaches.</li>
</ul>
<p>More specifically, you need to consider the following aspects of
change:&nbsp;</p>
<ul>
  <li><a href="#Understanding Organizational Culture">understanding organizational 
    culture</a></li>
  <li><a href="#Managing concerns and attitudes">managing concerns and attitudes</a></li>
  <li><a href="#Changing and improving skills">changing and improving skills</a></li>
  <li><a href="#Defining Incentives&nbsp;">defining incentives</a></li>
</ul>
<h5><a name="Understanding Organizational Culture">Understanding Organizational
Culture</a></h5>
<p>To succeed with a change and make it permanent, you must also understand, and 
  possibly change, the culture of the target organization. If you fail to understand 
  the culture of the target organization, any <a href="../glossary.htm#business_engineering">business 
  engineering</a> effort will fail.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Even if your business-modeling effort is not aimed at any radical change, the 
  culture is important to understand—enough so that you can avoid introducing 
  elements to the organization that disturb it in an unexpected way.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Culture is not something you can touch or describe with a simple formula.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Champy [<a href="../referenc.htm#CHM95">CHM95</a>] characterizes the culture 
  of a healthy business as a culture of &quot;willingness.&quot; Specifically, 
  Champy suggests that employees in a new business must be willing to: 
<ul>
  <li>always perform to the highest measure of competence 
  <li>take initiatives and risks 
  <li>adapt to change 
  <li>make decisions
  <li>work cooperatively as a team
  <li>be open, especially with information, knowledge, and news of forthcoming 
    or actual &quot;problems&quot; 
  <li>trust and be trustworthy. 
  <li>respect others, including customers, suppliers, colleagues, and themselves
  <li>answer for their actions and accept responsibility 
  <li>judge and be judged, to reward and be rewarded, on the basis of performance</li>
</ul>
<p>It is not easy to change a business' culture, or any culture for that matter. 
  This alone is the subject of entire books. Again, Champy [<a href="../referenc.htm#CHM95">CHM95</a>] 
  provides the inspiration for a brief description of the recommended procedure: 
<ul>
  <li>Determine the shared values of the people in the existing business.
  <li>Identify and weed out bad behavior.
  <li>Articulate what values and behaviors you want.
  <li>Determine if your management use cases support your aspirations for certain 
    values and behaviors. If they do not, it is impossible to change the culture. 
  <li>Install new values by teaching, doing, and living according to them.</li>
</ul>
<p>The path to a changed culture is full of traps. Repeated here are four of the
&quot;don'ts&quot; that Champy [<a href="../referenc.htm#CHM95">CHM95</a>] warns
against:
<ul>
  <li>Don't tolerate people who refuse to change their behavior, especially if
    their work is important to achieving your engineering goals. When you
    tolerate old behaviors, it signals that you are not serious about change.
    This applies to everyone—managers and team members alike.
  <li>Don't expect people to change how they behave unless you arrange their
    work to allow them to act differently.
  <li>Don't expect immediate cultural change. A complete cultural change takes a
    few years, not a few months.
  <li>Don't delay engineering the management use cases to support the new set of
    values.</li>
</ul>
<h5><a name="Managing concerns and attitudes">Managing Concerns and
Attitudes&nbsp;</a></h5>
<p>Areas to consider are:&nbsp;</p>
<ul>
  <li>Business idea and strategies—are they explained well and understood by
    everyone?&nbsp;</li>
  <li>Functionally oriented versus process-oriented organization—are you
    changing to a process oriented organization, and, in that case, are the
    benefits explained and understood?</li>
  <li>The coming change—change is less threatening if you explain what it
    entails, and also what is motivating it. The change should be motivated not
    just from the perspective of the members of the business, but also from the
    perspective the customers.&nbsp;</li>
  <li>Business culture—does the culture support the proposed changes?&nbsp;</li>
</ul>
<h5><a name="Changing and improving skills">Changing and Improving Skills</a></h5>
<p>There are needs for education at several levels and we have chosen to show 
  three categories. For general skills and for some domain-specific skills, you 
  may find externally available programs. For skills that are more specific to 
  your organization, you need to develop and plan for presentations, workshops, 
  and, in some cases, more extensive training programs.&nbsp;</p>
<p>General skills:&nbsp;</p>
<ul>
  <li>A process-oriented organization is focused on the customer. You may need
    to build an awareness of the difference between delivering value to the
    customer and just following procedures.&nbsp;</li>
  <li>Responsibilities are distributed to the individuals working in the
    processes, which might require that you make sure everyone clearly
    understands enough of the business rules to make the right decisions.&nbsp;</li>
</ul>
<p>Domain-specific skills:&nbsp;</p>
<ul>
  <li>Do you have a general understanding of the business, including products 
    and services?</li>
  <li>What business actors (customers, partners, vendors) are involved?
  <li>What results are produced and what services are delivered?
  <li>How is this related to your work responsibilities within the processes?</li>
</ul>
<p>Business-process specific skills:&nbsp;</p>
<ul>
  <li>You need a good knowledge of the process or processes of the business. 
  <li>You need a good knowledge of the responsibilities defined for the business 
    workers that you will act as, along with an ability to perform the activities 
    of the business worker. 
  <li>You need an understanding of your colleagues’ responsibilities and activities. 
  <li>You need a knowledge of how to use the business tools.</li>
</ul>
<p>Achieving the right skills within the organization may be the result of a combination 
  of training existing employees and hiring new people.&nbsp;</p>
<h5><a name="Defining Incentives&nbsp;">Defining Incentives&nbsp;</a></h5>
<p>Define a reward system that encourages employees to work in the direction of 
  the business idea and business strategy to satisfy the needs of the served actors. 
  With the goals of the individual business processes, which as a starting point 
  should be based on business ideas and strategies, define rewards related to: 
<ul>
  <li>overall performance of the business 
  <li>overall performance of the business process 
  <li>results of the individual execution (instance) of a business process 
  <li>contributions of each individual&nbsp;</li>
</ul>
<p>Investigate existing incentives for all kinds of employees in the target
organization. Rewards in a functionally oriented organization are often related
to the individual functional organization unit, which fails to capture that it
is the overall result of the business and its business processes that are the
essential aspects. Such incentives need to be replaced as soon as possible.</p>
<p>A smooth transfer from the old to the new reward system, however, is essential 
  for the acceptance of changes among the employees.</p>
<p>As a prerequisite for success, the staff members must have the right equipment, 
  and that equipment must be optimally located in relation to their tasks.&nbsp;</p>
<h3><a name="Geographic View">The Geographic View<img src="../../images/top.gif" alt="To top of page" border="0" width="26" height="20"></a></h3>
<p>In a service industry, optimal location is often relatively easy to arrange, 
  whereas in a manufacturing company, the changes in a business process might 
  become both expensive and extensive. The budget and the available time frame 
  often limit what is possible to achieve on a single project.</p>
<p>The importance of the location varies between different kinds of processes. A
telesales process, a field sales process, and a manufacturing process
significantly differ in this respect. The possibility for a business-engineering
effort to affect where and how the organization will be located in the future
also differs significantly between projects.</p>
<p>The following procedure helps determine a realistic approach:
<ul>
  <li>Look at each business use case to see how the involved business workers
    should be physically located in order to optimally perform the tasks.</li>
  <li>Look at the use-case realizations, one by one, to identify the needs of
    equipment and premises for each business worker.</li>
  <li>Look at the whole business, or a group of related business use cases, and
    consider:
    <ul>
      <li>Which business workers participate in several business use cases?</li>
      <li>Which processes make use of each other’s results?</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>With this as a basis, identify the optimal location of each business
    worker.</li>
  <li>Compare this with the current situation and ask yourself:
    <ul>
      <li>What is a realistic change within the mandate of the project?</li>
      <li>What is the most cost-effective location?</li>
      <li>What is mandatory? What can the organization live without?</li>
      <li>What can be compensated for by having the right equipment?</li>
      <li>What can be compensated for by having the right location?</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>Consider the effect of relocating an entire business system on the
    business use cases.</li>
  <li>Estimate the cost per business use case to change the location according 
    to what you have discovered. Determine whether the investment is realistic.</li>
</ul>
<p>For example, a mobile data solution must be considered for a sales person who
needs direct access to company databases while at the customer’s offices.
Having video-conferencing equipment installed sometimes compensates for the
disadvantage of having the members of a development team located at different
sites.</p>
<h3><a name="Architectural Tradeoffs">Architectural Tradeoffs<img src="../../images/top.gif" alt="To top of page" border="0" width="26" height="20"></a></h3>
<p>This section of the Business Architecture Document describes the how the business 
  architecture realizes the architectural goals and constraints (<b>architectural 
  drivers</b>) described near the beginning of this document. It is a discussion 
  for preserving the rationale underlying architectural decisions. Most, or at 
  least many, architectural drivers are conflicting, and the business architecture 
  must therefore provide an optimal solution that satisfies the greatest number 
  of conflicting drivers to the greatest possible extent. This implies that tradeoffs 
  and decisions will have to be made. It is these decisions and tradeoffs that 
  are described here. 
<p> As an example, one architectural goal may be the ability to rapidly deploy 
  new products, while another architectural goal may be the ability to deliver 
  products via partners with complementary offerings. These two goals are conflicting, 
  because delivering product via external partners implies a longer time-to-market. 
  In such a case, this section of the would describe the tradeoffs made within 
  the business architecture to achieve the maximum of both these goals.&nbsp; 
  In this example, a partner product management team might be created, and certain 
  restrictions might be applied to the selection of candidate partners. 
<p>Many conflicts and tradeoffs will surface only after the application architecture 
  or technical architecture is considered (see <a href="../workflow/busmodel/co_barch.htm">Concept: 
  Business Architecture</a>). It is essential that the consequences of these decisions 
  be clearly understood.</p>
