<p>
The Rational Unified Process is a flexible software development process
platform. Through its configurable architecture, RUP enables you to select and
deploy only the process components (including roles, activities, templates,
guidelines and tool mentors) you need for each stage of your project. With
industry-proven software engineering best practices at its core, the RUP
platform includes tools for configuring RUP for your project's specific needs,
tools for developing your own internal knowledge into process components,
powerful and customizable web-based deployment tools, and an online community
for exchanging best practices with peers and industry leaders. By using a proven
methodology and sharing a single comprehensive process, your team will be able
to communicate more effectively and work more efficiently.

<p>The RUP browser is your window into a custom process configuration, allowing
you to look at different views of it, create your own views, search the contents
and access the elements of it most pertinent to your location in tools through
