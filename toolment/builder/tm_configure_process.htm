</h2>


<h3>Purpose</h3>
<p>RUP Builder allows project managers to select the subset of the RUP process
and any available plug-ins that make sense for their project.&nbsp; This
eliminates process clutter, and removes confusing links from the process
web-site, so that project staff and the project manager can focus on the
activities and artifacts that are relevant.</p>

<p>The steps in this tool mentor assume that you've launched RUP Builder,
selected a template or custom configuration, and have described it.&nbsp;
Changes you make to plug-in and component selection are automatically updated in
the process views section of RUP Builder.</p>

<h3><a name="StepNumber1">Select Plug-ins</a> <a href="#Top"><img src="../../images/top.gif"alt="To top of page" border="0" width="26" height="20"></a>
</h3>

<p>A RUP Plug-in is a collection of process elements that are packaged
together.&nbsp; The elements extend the base RUP process by adding new elements
or contributing to existing ones, or by suppressing elements that don't make
sense in the context of that process.</p>
<p>Plug-ins are shown in a hierarchical tree in the 'Process Plug-in Choices'
sub-panel of 'Select Process' panel of RUP Builder.&nbsp; Plug-ins are usually
dependent directly on the RUP base, but may be dependent on another
plug-in.&nbsp; An example of the latter are the BEA and IBM WebSphere plug-ins,
which are dependent on the RUP J2EE plug-in.</p>
<p>Each of the template configurations that come with the RUP, or that your
organization has created for you, will have a combination of plug-ins
pre-selected for the type of project being undertaken.&nbsp; You may not need to
do anything other than select the template.</p>
<p>Choose plug-ins that extend the RUP in ways that directly benefit your
project.&nbsp; For example, if you were developing in J2EE, you would select the
J2EE plug-in, as it brings additional material specific to J2EE that will
benefit your project team, and puts it in context of the tasks they will be
required to perform.</p>
<p>Similarly, if your project is co-located and informal, you would choose the
Informal Resources instead of the Formal Resources plug-in.</p>
<p>As you select a plug-in by clicking on the check box, it will appear in the
'Selectable Process Components' sub-panel to the right of the plug-in selection
panel.</p>


<h3><a name="StepNumber2">Optional: Download Plug-ins from the RUP Plug-in
Exchange</a> <a href="#Top"><img src="../../images/top.gif"alt="To top of page" border="0" width="26" height="20"></a> 
</h3>

<p>There are more plug-ins than the ones delivered with the installed version of
RUP.&nbsp; Our internal staff, Alliance Members and other parties create new
plug-ins regularly and share them on the RUP Plug-in Exchange on the Rational
Developer Network (www.rational.net).</p>

<p>To get more plug-ins, select the hyperlink to the RUP Plug-in Exchange in the
thin box below the plug-in and component panels.&nbsp; This will launch the
Rational Developer Network in a new browser window.&nbsp; You will be required
to log-in to the Rational Developer Network. To register for RDN you will need
your Rational account number, available from your Rational sales representative.</p>

<p>The RUP Plug-in Exchange contains information on how to create new plug-ins,
how to share plug-ins and, of course, RUP Plug-ins for your re-use.&nbsp; Review
the plug-ins and follow the instructions to download a plug-in to your local
disk.</p>

<p>Once you have downloaded a plug-in to a local disk, select <u>R</u>epository
-&gt; Load <u>P</u>lug-in.&nbsp; This will bring up a standard file browser
window.&nbsp; Locate the plug-in you downloaded, select it and select OK.&nbsp;
The plug-in will be loaded into your Builder repository, and will appear in the
list of plug-ins in the 'Process Plug-in Choices' sub-panel.&nbsp; You can then
select it as usual.</p>


<h3><a name="StepNumber3">Review Process Components</a> <a href="#Top"><img src="../../images/top.gif"alt="To top of page" border="0" width="26" height="20"></a> 
</h3>

<p>The RUP is divided into about 60 selectable process components, with more
process components in the plug-ins.&nbsp; These are tightly coupled groups of
process elements that can be added or removed from the process
configuration.&nbsp; Process components can contain other process components as
well.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

<p>Clicking on the check box associated with a process component selects or
deselects it.&nbsp; Deselecting a process component that contains other process
components deselects the children components as well.&nbsp;</p>

<p>You can expand or collapse the component tree by clicking on the + or -
symbols on the components.&nbsp; Expanding a component allows you to see the
headings of the process elements contained within that component.&nbsp; Some
process elements contain sub-levels of process elements as well, so you can
drill down to the details of what you are working one.</p>

<p>The template configuration that you chose when you launched RUP Builder has
already made many of the process component selections for you.&nbsp; If your
organization created template configurations specific to the types of project
you are running, you may not need to do any further selection.</p>

<p>It is likely that you will need to make further refinements to the
choices.&nbsp; The easiest method to do this is to have the Classic RUP
configuration that is installed on your workstation open.&nbsp; To find out
exactly what a process element is, search for it in the RUP.&nbsp; This will
enable you to make an informed choice about whether to select the process
component or not.</p>

<p>Remember that you are expected to do this on a regular basis throughout the
project, so don't get bogged down in making the perfect selection
immediately.&nbsp; You will iteratively define your project process over the
life of the project.</p>

<p>You may also want to deselect process components that you are not going to
return to in the life of the project.&nbsp; For example, you will likely define
your requirements management plan during Inception, and possibly update it
during Elaboration, but it may be fixed and well understood by
Construction.&nbsp; At that point, it may be worth removing the 'Requirements
Management' component from your configuration.</p>

<p>All of the Rational tools and possibly tools defined by your organization are
selectable components, enabling you to include only the tool support for tools
you will actually use in your project.&nbsp; They are sub-components of the
'Tools' component.</p>

<p>You'll note that some process components are grayed out.&nbsp; The component
container itself will not appear in the published configuration, only the
contents. This is done to remove unnecessary levels of hierarchy.</p>

<p>You'll also notice small triangles with exclamation points in them.&nbsp;
These indicate a problem of some sort with the selected components.&nbsp; You
can expand the tree and drill down until you find the explicit causes of the
problems.&nbsp; Most of them will not significantly impact your process choices
and can be safely ignored.</p>


<h3><a name="StepNumber4">Save Your Process Configuration</a> <a href="#Top"><img src="../../images/top.gif"alt="To top of page" border="0" width="26" height="20"></a> 
</h3>

<p>After making a series of changes, its a good idea to save your selections to
a custom configuration for your project if you have not already done so.&nbsp;
That way, the next time you update your process configuration, you can start
from the same place you left off, and iterate your process and its views most
effectively.</p>
