<p class="MsoBodyText">To build e-business applications means building Internet

solutions to implement business processes. This includes e-commerce, but extends

to all business processes throughout an organization.&nbsp; 



The basic concepts and technologies used in an e-business solution are described in <a href="../process/workflow/busmodel/co_ebiz.htm">Concepts:

e-business Development</a>.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>E-business systems can be divided into:</p>

<ul>

  <li>first generation systems that simply use the web to publish information</li>

  <li>second generation systems that implement e-commerce and simple transactional models</li>

  <li>third generation systems that completely re-engineer a process to provide highly 

personalized (business-to-consumer or business-to-business) solutions that are

adaptive and automate the complete business process, often integrating with

legacy systems and internet devices</li>

</ul>

<p>The further along the systems are in the generations, the

more complex their development.</p>

<h4>Business Modeling<o:p> </o:p> </h4>

<p class="node">In general, there is a much higher focus on business modeling

compared to other types of development efforts. To develop an e-business

application generally means to develop a new way of doing business; it's an

integral part of the way you run your business.

<ul>

  <li><a href="../process/workflow/busmodel/wfs_stat.htm"><b>Workflow Detail:

    Assess Business Status</b></a></li>

</ul>

<blockquote>

  <p class="node">The focus here is to understand the

  problems the new business should solve, and also the effects of not developing the

  new business.</p>

  <p class="node">Building e-business solutions involves a

  greater variety of stakeholders than other software application development

  projects. These stakeholders will usually include business executives,

  marketing, creative design, customer support, and the technology development

  team, among others.</p>

  <p class="node">The <a href="../process/activity/ac_sgoals.htm">Activity: Set

  and Adjust Goals</a> focuses on ensuring that the new business

  will meet the needs of this varied group of stakeholders. The primary artifact

  where these needs are expressed is the <a href="../process/artifact/ar_bvsio.htm">Business

  Vision</a>. Given the diverse backgrounds of the stakeholders, a facilitated

  workshop, like the one described in <a href="../process/workguid/wg_rqwsh.htm">Work

  Guidelines: Requirements Workshop</a>, is often needed to bring the group

  together. Extensive use of storyboards to describe the desired customer

  experience tend to be useful in eliciting feedback (see <a href="../process/workguid/wg_stbd.htm">Work

  Guidelines: Storyboarding</a>).</p>

  <p class="node">Sometimes the stakeholders are not available because they

  are only on the Internet. In these cases an important role of the Business

  Vision document is to describe how the stakeholders or customers should find

  the Web site and how user feedback is going to be collected. As well, in these cases

  you can develop prototypes to learn how customers find the Web site and how

  they are using it. The need to obtain this kind of feedback may affect the

  length of the iterations and the product lifecycle.

        what's their <b>connection

        speed</b>? Is there a minimum speed specified or assumed in the

        design?</li>

      <li>The degree of <b>user-interaction</b>; for example, should we only inform

        the user or should we try to communicate with the actor (two-way

        communication)? Should the design of the application be different

        depending on which user is accessing the application?</li>

      <li>The <b>browsers</b>  that users will be using,

        including differences across operating systems</li>

      <li>Whether the site will use <b>frames</b></li>

      <li>Any <b>color</b> limitations the site will

  <p class="node">The 'Creative Design Brief' evolves into the user interface

<ul>

  <li><a href="../process/workflow/ana_desi/wfs_and1.htm"><b>Workflow Detail: 

    Define a Candidate Architecture</b></a> 

    <p class="node">The <a href="../process/activity/ac_arcan.htm">Activity: Architectural 

      Analysis</a> takes advantage of the knowledge that a Web application has 

      a relatively well-defined architecture, including a set of well-defined 

      mechanisms (Web browsers, Java applets and servlets, ASPs and JSPs, and 

      the like). Usually a simple layering structure as described in <a href="../process/workflow/ana_desi/co_layer.htm">Concepts: 

      Layering</a> is sufficient unless the Web application development framework 

      is more specific. In many cases, there may be predefined, off-the-shelf 

      architectures that can be purchased or re-used from prior Web development 

      projects. Web application frameworks, such as IBM's WebSphere or Microsoft's 

      Windows DNA, provide just this sort of architectural template.</p>

    <p class="node">Web applications typically do not have scheduled downtime. 

      The architecture may (and typically does) need to provide for upgrading 

      the system while it's running, and switching to standby servers during primary 

      server failure or when maintenance or server upgrades occur. Some Web application 

      frameworks provide tools for production support. Regardless, if your application 

      has high-availability requirements, you will need to plan to buy or build 

      the infrastructure necessary to support this requirement, and to integrate 

      the support for this capability into the architecture.</p>

  </li>

  <li><b><a href="../process/workflow/ana_desi/wfs_and3.htm">Workflow Detail: 

    Analyze Behavior</a></b> 

    <p class="node">The <a href="../process/activity/ac_desui.htm">Activity: Design 

      the User Interface</a> is performed iteratively within the Elaboration iterations. 

      The early executions of this activity focus on producing 'creative design 

      comps', which are mocked-up representations of the design of key Web pages 

      in the site. These 'comps' are typically &quot;flat&quot; pictures framed 

      with browser window graphics to give a look of a browser window. The main 

      benefit of 'comps' is to postpone the investment of more elaborate and costly 

      HTML prototypes until there is consensus on the specific graphical direction 

      for the site.</p>

    <p class="node">'Creative Design Comps' are created by looking at the interface 

      requirements of the most important Use Cases and developing many alternative 

      designs (perhaps 10 or more) for its look and feel. From this set, the three 

      most promising options are chosen to present to the stakeholders. This is 

      done iteratively until there is agreement on the final Web design, resulting 

      in a set of <a href="../process/artifact/ar_storyboard.htm">Storyboards</a> and a 

	  <a href="../process/artifact/ar_navmap.htm">Navigational Map</a>. 

    <p class="node">Once there is agreement and sign-off, the creative design 

      comps evolve into a functional <a href="../process/artifact/ar_uiprt.htm">User-Interface 

      Prototype</a> through repetition of the <a href="../process/activity/ac_uip.htm">Activity: 

      Prototype the User Interface</a>. The Initial Web UI Prototype typically 

      supports only portions of the system&#151the most important and architecturally 

      significant use cases. It's important to have a good structure in the Use 

      Case flow-of-events before developing prototypes to ensure that functionality 

      drives the layout of the user interface and not the reverse.</p>

    <p class="node">In subsequent iterations, the Web prototype is expanded, gradually 

      adding broader coverage of the use cases and deeper exercise of the architecture.</p>

    <p class="node">The <a href="../process/activity/ac_ucana.htm">Activity: Use-Case 

      Analysis</a> is relatively unchanged, except that it's important to focus 

      on not only the behavior of the GUI, but also the underlying business logic 

      &#151 the part that will typically run on either the Web server or the application 

      server. If this is forgotten, the most significant portion of the system 

      behavior will be overlooked. Web pages themselves are represented as 'boundary' 

      classes, data elements are represented as 'entity' classes, and server-side 

      behavior (for example, active server pages, servlets, and such) is represented 

      through 'control' objects.</p>

    <p class="node">Immediately following use-case analysis, the <a href="../process/activity/ac_iddes.htm">Activity: 

      Identify Design Elements</a> refines the <a href="../process/artifact/ar_aclss.htm">Artifact: 

      Analysis Classes</a>, mapping them onto existing mechanisms in the web development 

      framework, reusing existing design elements from prior projects or iteration 

      where possible. This often requires readjusting the scope and definition 

      of the identified analysis classes to achieve the desired degree of reuse.</p>

    <p class="node">A more detailed description of the use of UML to describe 

      Web applications is described in <a href="../papers/webapps.htm">Modeling

      design elements</b>&#151the discrete graphical images that are assembled 

      to build the Web pages for a site&#151are created. Consistency of the user 

      interface across a Web site is essential to usability; the Web site should 

      provide a consistent user experience. To ensure this, the project must consistently 

      use a set of standard graphical elements across the whole site.</p>

    <p class="node">The development of these

      reduces time to market, and reduces development cost as well as increases 
      quality by deploying a smaller set of higher quality elements.</p>

    <p class="node">The preparation of guidelines is done in conjunction with 
      the development of the initial Web <a href="../process/artifact/ar_uiprt.htm">User-Interface

      requirements of the system onto the mechanisms provided by the Web development 

      framework; mechanisms not provided by the framework (if it exists) will 

      need to be identified and alternative solutions found.</p>

    <p class="node">The <a href="../process/activity/ac_concr.htm">Activity: Describe

      manage concurrency in the application. Typically there is little or no control

      the Web development framework will provide a fixed number of server types 

      (for example, web servers, application servers, mail servers, communication 

      gateway servers) with relatively well-defined functional boundaries. The 

      software architect's skill, as a result, becomes focused on determining 

      how to deal with scalability and fault tolerance requirements using the 

      available server types, usually by determining how many of each kind of 

      server are needed. In addition, measurement plans need to be made to determine 

      how to know when additional servers are needed.</p>

      Subsystem Integration</a> and <a href="../process/activity/ac_plsyi.htm">Activity: 

      Plan System Integration</a> need to address the different kinds of implementation

    <p class="node">The <a href="../process/activity/ac_impcl.htm">Activity: Implement 

      Design Elements</a> focuses on several different kinds of elements:</p>

    <blockquote> 

      <ul>

        <li>Web pages, applets, scripts, graphics, and other elements that &quot;execute&quot; 

          in the browser environment</li>

        <li>Server-side pages, scripts, servlets, and other elements which &quot;execute&quot; 

          in the Web server environment</li>

        <li>Executable code enhancements to legacy applications</li>

        <li>Database tables, triggers, stored procedures, and other elements that 

          execute in the database management system</li>

      </ul>

    </blockquote>

    <p class="node">The differences in the tools, and the deployment technologies 

      between these different kinds of elements, means there will be a number 

      of similar variations on the <a href="../process/activity/ac_impcl.htm">Activity: 

      Implement Design Elements</a>. There will be similar adaptations in the

<ul>

  <li><b>Product release </b>in the Web environment tends to be

    incremental and continuous, and less focused on the traditional distribution of

    media. Release planning must be adjusted accordingly.</li>

  <li><b>User education</b> in the Web environment tends to be

    integrated into the design of the Web site itself, so that the use of the

    site is intuitive. Creation of traditional education and user manuals or

    documentation is reduced, with increased emphasis on graphic and content

    design at the front-end of the process.</li>

  <li><b>Production application support</b> in the Web environment

    must focus on maintaining high availability under unpredictable load. It may

    also need to be able to provide the ability to continue running when primary

    servers fail, and to allow for server upgrades while the system is running.</li>

  <li><b>Knowledge transfer</b> from the development team to the

    production support team must occur, so that the production support staff is

    capable of running the system and performing routine maintenance.</li>

  <li><b>Follow up how the users are using the application</b>. This

    information is valuable for learning who is using the application and how

    it's being used. These observations can assist in developing further releases to improve

    user interaction.</li>
