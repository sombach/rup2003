<p>The key to achieving the delicate balance between delivering quality software 
  and delivering it quickly (the software paradox!) is to understand the essential 
  elements of the process and to follow certain guidelines for tailoring the process 
  to best fit your project's specific needs. This should be done while adhering 
  to the best practices that have been proven throughout the industry to help 
  software development projects be successful.</p>
<h3><a name="definition">Definition of &quot;Small Project&quot;</a><a href="#Top"><img alt="To top of page" border="0" src="../images/top.gif" width="26" height="20"></a></h3>
<p>Small can refer to the number of people on the project, the length of the project, 
  or the amount of software being developed. For the purposes of this roadmap, 
  a &quot;Small Project&quot; is defined as a project with:</p>
<ul>
  <li>3 to10 people</li>
  <li>project duration less than one year.</li>
</ul>
<h3><a name="characteristics">Characteristics of a Small Project Process </a><a href="#Top"><img alt="To top of page" border="0" src="../images/top.gif" width="26" height="20"></a></h3>
<p>A key characteristic of most small projects is a lower level of formality. 
  Although there are exceptions, the larger the number of people on the project 
  and the larger and more complex the product, the greater the need for formal 
  process. For example, if your project has a geographically distributed team 
  of 100 people, or is working simultaneously on multiple related products with 
  multiple customers and subcontractors, you require much more formal process 
  than a typical five-person team. Similarly, a missile guidance system requires 
  more formal artifacts than an inventory system upgrade.</p>
<p>So why have a process at all? A process enables successful practices to be 
  repeated, and unsuccessful practices to be dropped or improved. RUP in particular 
  provides: </p>
<ul>
  <li> guidance on best practices</li>
  <li>a set of activities, roles, and artifacts your process may need to consider 
    - with guidance on when these are needed</li>
  <li> lots of good detailed information that help you effectively apply the techniques 
    that you decide are appropriate for your project. For example, if you are 
    doing a UML design model, you find out what diagrams are appropriate and how 
    to structure the model. Further, if you use Rational tools, there's additional 
    guidance on how to use them effectively as part of the overall process.</li>
  <li>guidance on how to tailor the process to address specific process-related 
    problems. For example, if your project has a lot of changing requirements, 
    you may benefit from the guidance on how to effectively manage requirements.<br>
  </li>
</ul>
<p></p>
<p>Many of the same RUP activities and artifacts are needed on both small and 
  large projects - the differences are more in terms of artifact formats and the 
  level of formality, detail, and effort applied to each activity. For the purposes 
  of this roadmap, a &quot;small project process&quot; will focus on projects 
  which require little formality. Some characteristics of this small project process 
  are as follows.</p>
<ul>
  <li>The number of documents tends to be smaller, and less detailed. Instead 
    of detailed Risk Management Plans and Product Acceptance Plans, small projects 
    may devote a couple of paragraphs to these topics as part of the overall Software 
    Development Plan. The Test Plan for each iteration may be a few paragraphs 
    in the Iteration Plan. </li>
  <li>Small projects often start off with a minimum of software development tools. 
    As a project grows and succeeds (which is the objective of all successful 
    small projects!), it will be important to include effective tools to help 
    automate your team's <a href="../manuals/intro/im_implbp.htm">implementation 
    of the best practices</a>.</li>
  <li> Formal reviews may be replaced with informal meetings and discussions.</li>
  <li>Many of the artifacts may be captured informally. A risk list may be created 
    on a whiteboard, and status assessments may be a few paragraphs in an email.</li>
</ul>
<h3><a name="getstarted">How to Get Started</a><a href="#Top"><img alt="To top of page" border="0" src="../images/top.gif" width="26" height="20"></a></h3>
<p>To define a process for your small project, you should first review the following 
  RUP basics:</p>
<ul>
  <li> <a href="../manuals/intro/im_esstl.htm">Process Essentials</a> </li>
  <li> <a href="../process/modguide/md_tailr.htm">Tailoring the Process</a> </li>
  <li><a href="../manuals/intro/im_bp.htm">Best Practices for Developing Software.</a>
</ul>
<p>Then evaluate any existing process you may be following against these essentials, 
  and focus revisions on any weak areas. Many projects choose to incrementally 
  adopt new tools and process, and initially use only small parts of RUP. </p>
<p>The <a href="rm_smprj_scenario.htm">Scenario: A Small Project Adopts RUP</a>, 
  gives an example for how a small project might approach defining a process. 
  Detailed guidance for defining and documenting a software development process 
  for a project is provided by <a href="../process/activity/ac_tlrprjprc.htm">Activity: 
  Tailor the Process for the Project</a>, including tool mentors that describe 
  how to create a tailored process using RUP Builder.</p>
<p>These tool mentors describe how you can select and deselect RUP process components 
  to perform a coarse tailoring of the process, and do finer tuning with process 
  views, including adding your own project-specific guidelines. Note that RUP 
  Builder includes a Small Project process template configuration. This is a smaller 
  configuration of the RUP that includes &quot;informal&quot; templates and excludes 
  guidance applicable to larger or more formal projects. Small projects should 
  start with this template and apply their own project-specific tailoring.</p>

<p>Smaller projects in particular may wish to adopt practices and techniques associated 
  with &quot;Agile Processes&quot;. This is discussed in <a href="../process/workflow/environm/co_agile.htm">Concepts: 
  Agile Practices in RUP</a> and in <a href="../papers/smproj.htm">White Paper: 
  Using the RUP for Small Projects: Expanding upon eXtreme Programming.</a></p>
