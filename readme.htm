<p>This file provides troubleshooting information when running Rational Unified Process 
and Extended Help in the Mckinley Beta Release.</p>

<ol>
  <li><b>JRE plugin:</b><br>
    We recommend that you use the Sun Java 1.3.1_0X plugin. If you do not already
    have the plugin installed, you will be prompted to do so as soon as you try
    launching RUP or Extended Help for the first time. <br>
  </li>
  <br>
  <li><b>If running RUP or Extended Help from an HTTP server and you receive a message informing you that
        limited read/write access is required: </b><br>
   	Locate the <i>java.policy</i> file in your installed Sun Java plugin directory 
    	(e.g. C:\Program Files\JavaSoft\JRE\1.3.1_02\lib\security). <br>
    	Add the following permissions to the <i>java.policy</i> file (add them after the last "permissions" 
        line and before the "};" tag at the end of the file):
	<br>	
		&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp permission java.io.FilePermission "C:\\Documents and Settings\\username\\MyRup", "read,write,delete"; <br>
		&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp permission java.io.FilePermission "C:\\Documents and Settings\\username\\MyRup\\-", "read,write,delete"; <br>
		&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp permission java.lang.RuntimePermission "loadLibrary.environment"; <br>
	  	&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp permission java.util.PropertyPermission "user.name", "read"; <br>
  		&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp permission java.util.PropertyPermission "user.home", "read"; <br>
	  	&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp permission java.util.PropertyPermission "user.dir", "read"; <br>
  		&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp permission java.util.PropertyPermission "file.encoding", "read"; <br>
	  	&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp permission java.awt.AWTPermission "accessClipboard"; <br>
  		&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp permission java.awt.AWTPermission "showWindowWithoutWarningBanner"; <br>
	<br>
	Change the string <i>C:\\Documents and Settings\\username\\MyRup</i> to match with your user profile. <br>   
	For example, your string might look like <i>C:\\Documents and Settings\\jdoe\\MyRup</i>. <br>
	Notice that the change is to <i>username</i> in the string. <br>
	<br>
	Also, change the string <i>C:\\Documents and Settings\\username\\MyRup\\-</i> to match with your user profile. <br>   
	For example, your string might look like <i>C:\\Documents and Settings\\jdoe\\MyRup\\-</i>. <br>
	Notice that the change is to <i>username</i> in the string. <br>
	<br>
	<b>TIP: to find what your user profile is, run the command <i>echo %USERPROFILE%</i> in a command prompt window. </b><br>
  </li>
  <br>
  <li><b>When running a locally installed RUP or Extended Help and you receive a message informing
         you that limited read/write access is required: </b><br>
	Locate the directory where you had installed RUP. Go up a level to the <i>Common</i> directory and <br>
    	run <i>ConfigurePolicy.bat</i>. Typically, this is <i>C:\Program Files\Rational\Common\ConfigurePolicy.bat.</i> <br>

  </li>
  <br>
  <li>Make sure all your browser windows are closed before restarting RUP again. <br>
    To start RUP locally, go to Start -&gt; Program Files -&gt; Rational Unified Process (McKinley 
    Beta) -&gt; Rational Unified Process (McKinley Beta). <br>
    To start RUP from an HTTP server, simply launch the appropriate URL again. <br></li>
