  it. Please note also that Licensor has expended considerable<br>
  professional effort in the production of this Product, and continues<br>

<p>Licensor's entire liability under this warranty shall be, at<br>
  Licensor's option, either to refund the license fee paid by<br>
  Licensee or to replace the medium on which the Product is provided.<br>
  This is also Licensee's exclusive remedy. To qualify for this<br>
  remedy, Licensee must demonstrate satisfactory proof of purchase to<br>
  Licensor and return the Product in reasonably good condition to<br>
  Licensor or certify its destruction in writing.</p>

derived, directly or indirectly, from Original Code provided by the Initial Developer
and including the name of the Initial Developer in (a) the Source Code, and (b)
in any notice in an Executable version or related documentation in which You
describe the origin or ownership of the Covered Code. 
</p>

<p  ><b>3.4. Intellectual Property Matters</b> 
</p>

<p  ><b>(a) Third Party Claims</b>. <br>
If Contributor has knowledge that a license under a third party's intellectual
property rights is required to exercise the rights granted by such Contributor
under Sections 2.1 or 2.2, Contributor must include a text file with the Source
Code distribution titled &quot;LEGAL'' which describes the claim and the party
making the claim in sufficient detail that a recipient will know whom to
contact. If Contributor obtains such knowledge after the Modification is made
available as described in Section 3.2, Contributor shall promptly modify the
LEGAL file in all copies Contributor makes available thereafter and shall take
other steps (such as notifying appropriate mailing lists or newsgroups)
reasonably calculated to inform those who received the Covered Code that new
knowledge has been obtained. 
</p>

<p  ><b>(b) Contributor APIs</b>. <br>
If Contributor's Modifications include an application programming interface and
Contributor has knowledge of patent licenses which are reasonably necessary to implement
that API, Contributor must also include this information in the LEGAL file. 
</p>

<p  ><b>(c)&nbsp; Representations.</b> 
</p>

<p  >Contributor represents that, except as
disclosed pursuant to Section 3.4(a) above, Contributor believes that
Contributor's Modifications are Contributor's original creation(s) and/or
Contributor has sufficient rights to grant the rights conveyed by this License.</p>

<p  ><br>
<b>3.5. Required Notices.</b> <br>
You must duplicate the notice in <b>Exhibit A</b> in each file of the Source
Code. If it is not possible to put such notice in a particular Source Code file
due to its structure, then You must include such notice in a location (such as
a relevant directory) where a user would be likely to look for such a notice.
If You created one or more Modification(s) You may add your name as a
Contributor to the notice described in <b>Exhibit A</b>. You must also
duplicate this License in any documentation for the Source Code where You
describe recipients' rights or ownership rights relating to Covered Code. You
may choose to offer, and to charge a fee for, warranty, support, indemnity or
liability obligations to one or more recipients of Covered Code. However, You
may do so only on Your own behalf, and not on behalf of the Initial Developer
or any Contributor. You must make it absolutely clear than any such warranty,
support, indemnity or liability obligation is offered by You alone, and You
hereby agree to indemnify the Initial Developer and every Contributor for any
liability incurred by the Initial Developer or such Contributor as a result of
warranty, support, indemnity or liability terms You offer. 
</p>

<p  ><b>3.6. Distribution of Executable Versions.</b> <br>
You may distribute Covered Code in Executable form only if the requirements of
Section <b>3.1-3.5</b> have been met for that Covered Code, and if You include
a notice stating that the Source Code version of the Covered Code is available
under the terms of this License, including a description of how and where You
have fulfilled the obligations of Section <b>3.2</b>. The notice must be
conspicuously included in any notice in an Executable version, related
documentation or collateral in which You describe recipients' rights relating
to the Covered Code. You may distribute the Executable version of Covered Code
or ownership rights under a license of Your choice, which may contain terms
different from this License, provided that You are in compliance with the terms
of this License and that the license for the Executable version does not
attempt to limit or alter the recipient's rights in the Source Code version
from the rights set forth in this License. If You distribute the Executable
version under a different license You must make it absolutely clear that any
terms which differ from this License are offered by You alone, not by the
Initial Developer or any Contributor. You hereby agree to indemnify the Initial
Developer and every Contributor for any liability incurred by the Initial
Developer or such Contributor as a result of any such terms You offer. 
</p>

<p  ><b>3.7. Larger Works.</b> <br>
You may create a Larger Work by combining Covered Code with other code not
governed by the terms of this License and distribute the Larger Work as a
single product. In such a case, You must make sure the requirements of this
License are fulfilled for the Covered Code.
</p>

<p  ><b>4.
Inability to Comply Due to Statute or Regulation.</b> </p>

<p  >If it is impossible for You to comply with
any of the terms of this License with respect to some or all of the Covered
Code due to statute, judicial order, or regulation then You must: (a) comply
with the terms of this License to the maximum extent possible; and (b) describe
the limitations and the code they affect. Such description must be included in
the LEGAL file described in Section <b>3.4</b> and must be included with all
distributions of the Source Code. Except to the extent prohibited by statute or
regulation, such description must be sufficiently detailed for a recipient of
ordinary skill to be able to understand it.
</p>

<p  ><b>5.
Application of this License.</b> </p>

<p  >This License applies to code to which the
Initial Developer has attached the notice in <b>Exhibit A</b> and to related
Covered Code.
</p>

<p  ><b>6.
Versions of the License.</b> </p>

<p  ><b>6.1. New Versions</b>. <br>
Netscape Communications Corporation (''Netscape'') may publish revised and/or
new versions of the License from time to time. Each version will be given a
distinguishing version number. 
</p>

<p  ><b>6.2. Effect of New Versions</b>. <br>
Once Covered Code has been published under a particular version of the License,
You may always continue to use it under the terms of that version. You may also
choose to use such Covered Code under the terms of any subsequent version of
the License published by Netscape. No one other than Netscape has the right to
modify the terms applicable to Covered Code created under this License. 
</p>

<p  ><b>6.3. Derivative Works</b>. <br>
If You create or use a modified version of this License (which you may only do
in order to apply it to code which is not already Covered Code governed by this
License), You must (a) rename Your license so that the phrases ''Mozilla'',
''MOZILLAPL'', ''MOZPL'', ''Netscape'', &quot;MPL&quot;, ''NPL'' or any confusingly
similar phrase do not appear in your license (except to note that your license
differs from this License) and (b) otherwise make it clear that Your version of
the license contains terms which differ from the Mozilla Public License and
Netscape Public License. (Filling in the name of the Initial Developer,
Original Code or Contributor in the notice described in <b>Exhibit A</b> shall
not of themselves be deemed to be modifications of this License.)
</p>

<p  ><b>7.
DISCLAIMER OF WARRANTY.</b> </p>

<p  >COVERED CODE IS PROVIDED UNDER THIS LICENSE
ON AN &quot;AS IS&quot; BASIS, WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY KIND, EITHER EXPRESSED
OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING, WITHOUT LIMITATION, WARRANTIES THAT THE COVERED CODE IS
FREE OF DEFECTS, MERCHANTABLE, FIT FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE OR NON-INFRINGING.
THE ENTIRE RISK AS TO THE QUALITY AND PERFORMANCE OF THE COVERED CODE IS WITH
YOU. SHOULD ANY COVERED CODE PROVE DEFECTIVE IN ANY RESPECT, YOU (NOT THE
INITIAL DEVELOPER OR ANY OTHER CONTRIBUTOR) ASSUME THE COST OF ANY NECESSARY
SERVICING, REPAIR OR CORRECTION. THIS DISCLAIMER OF WARRANTY CONSTITUTES AN
ESSENTIAL PART OF THIS LICENSE. NO USE OF ANY COVERED CODE IS AUTHORIZED
HEREUNDER EXCEPT UNDER THIS DISCLAIMER.
</p>

<p  ><b>8.
TERMINATION.</b> </p>

<p  ><b>8.1. </b>This
License and the rights granted hereunder will terminate automatically if You
fail to comply with terms herein and fail to cure such breach within 30 days of
becoming aware of the breach. All sublicenses to the Covered Code which are
properly granted shall survive any termination of this License. Provisions
which, by their nature, must remain in effect beyond the termination of this
License shall survive. 
</p>

<p  ><b>8.2. </b>If
You initiate litigation by asserting a patent infringement claim (excluding
declatory judgment actions) against Initial Developer or a Contributor (the
Initial Developer or Contributor against whom You file such action is referred
to as &quot;Participant&quot;) alleging that: 
</p>

<p  ><b>(a) </b>such
Participant's Contributor Version directly or indirectly infringes any patent,
then any and all rights granted by such Participant to You under Sections 2.1
and/or 2.2 of this License shall, upon 60 days notice from Participant
terminate prospectively, unless if within 60 days after receipt of notice You
either: (i) agree in writing to pay Participant a mutually agreeable reasonable
royalty for Your past and future use of Modifications made by such Participant,
or (ii) withdraw Your litigation claim with respect to the Contributor Version
against such Participant. If within 60 days of notice, a reasonable royalty and
payment arrangement are not mutually agreed upon in writing by the parties or
the litigation claim is not withdrawn, the rights granted by Participant to You
under Sections 2.1 and/or 2.2 automatically terminate at the expiration of the
60 day notice period specified above. 
</p>

<p  ><b>(b)</b>
any software, hardware, or device, other than such Participant's Contributor
Version, directly or indirectly infringes any patent, then any rights granted
to You by such Participant under Sections 2.1(b) and 2.2(b) are revoked
effective as of the date You first made, used, sold, distributed, or had made,
Modifications made by that Participant. 
</p>

<p  ><b>8.3. </b>If
You assert a patent infringement claim against Participant alleging that such
Participant's Contributor Version directly or indirectly infringes any patent
where such claim is resolved (such as by license or settlement) prior to the
initiation of patent infringement litigation, then the reasonable value of the
licenses granted by such Participant under Sections 2.1 or 2.2 shall be taken
into account in determining the amount or value of any payment or license. </p>

<p  ><b>8.4.</b> In
the event of termination under Sections 8.1 or 8.2 above, all end user license
agreements (excluding distributors and resellers) which have been validly
granted by You or any distributor hereunder prior to termination shall survive
termination.
</p>

<p  ><b>9.
LIMITATION OF LIABILITY.</b> </p>

<p  >UNDER NO CIRCUMSTANCES AND UNDER NO LEGAL
THEORY, WHETHER TORT (INCLUDING NEGLIGENCE), CONTRACT, OR OTHERWISE, SHALL YOU,
THE INITIAL DEVELOPER, ANY OTHER CONTRIBUTOR, OR ANY DISTRIBUTOR OF COVERED CODE,
OR ANY SUPPLIER OF ANY OF SUCH PARTIES, BE LIABLE TO ANY PERSON FOR ANY
INDIRECT, SPECIAL, INCIDENTAL, OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES OF ANY CHARACTER
INCLUDING, WITHOUT LIMITATION, DAMAGES FOR LOSS OF GOODWILL, WORK STOPPAGE,
COMPUTER FAILURE OR MALFUNCTION, OR ANY AND ALL OTHER COMMERCIAL DAMAGES OR
LOSSES, EVEN IF SUCH PARTY SHALL HAVE BEEN INFORMED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH
DAMAGES. THIS LIMITATION OF LIABILITY SHALL NOT APPLY TO LIABILITY FOR DEATH OR
PERSONAL INJURY RESULTING FROM SUCH PARTY'S NEGLIGENCE TO THE EXTENT APPLICABLE
LAW PROHIBITS SUCH LIMITATION. SOME JURISDICTIONS DO NOT ALLOW THE EXCLUSION OR
LIMITATION OF INCIDENTAL OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES, SO THIS EXCLUSION AND
LIMITATION MAY NOT APPLY TO YOU.
</p>

<p  ><b>10.
U.S. GOVERNMENT END USERS.</b> </p>

<p  >The Covered Code is a ''commercial item,''
as that term is defined in 48 C.F.R. 2.101 (Oct. 1995), consisting of
''commercial computer software'' and ''commercial computer software
documentation,'' as such terms are used in 48 C.F.R. 12.212 (Sept. 1995).
Consistent with 48 C.F.R. 12.212 and 48 C.F.R. 227.7202-1 through 227.7202-4
(June 1995), all U.S. Government End Users acquire Covered Code with only those
rights set forth herein.
</p>

<p  ><b>11.
MISCELLANEOUS.</b> </p>

<p  >This License represents the complete agreement
concerning subject matter hereof. If any provision of this License is held to
be unenforceable, such provision shall be reformed only to the extent necessary
to make it enforceable. This License shall be governed by California law
provisions (except to the extent applicable law, if any, provides otherwise),
excluding its conflict-of-law provisions. With respect to disputes in which at
least one party is a citizen of, or an entity chartered or registered to do
business in the United States of America, any litigation relating to this
License shall be subject to the jurisdiction of the Federal Courts of the
Northern District of California, with venue lying in Santa Clara County,
California, with the losing party responsible for costs, including without
limitation, court costs and reasonable attorneys' fees and expenses. The
application of the United Nations Convention on Contracts for the International
Sale of Goods is expressly excluded. Any law or regulation which provides that
the language of a contract shall be construed against the drafter shall not
apply to this License.
</p>

<p  ><b>12.
RESPONSIBILITY FOR CLAIMS.</b> </p>

<p  >As between Initial Developer and the
Contributors, each party is responsible for claims and damages arising,
directly or indirectly, out of its utilization of rights under this License and
You agree to work with Initial Developer and Contributors to distribute such
responsibility on an equitable basis. Nothing herein is intended or shall be
deemed to constitute any admission of liability.
</p>

<p  ><b>13.
MULTIPLE-LICENSED CODE.</b> </p>

<p  >Initial Developer may designate portions of
the Covered Code as &quot;Multiple-Licensed&quot;. &quot;Multiple-Licensed&quot; means that the
Initial Developer permits you to utilize portions of the Covered Code under
Your choice of the MPL or the alternative licenses, if any, specified by the
Initial Developer in the file described in Exhibit A.

GNU GENERAL PUBLIC LICENSE<br>
Version 2, June 1991</p>
<p> Copyright (C) 1989, 1991 Free Software Foundation, Inc.<br>
  59 Temple Place, Suite 330, Boston, MA 02111-1307 USA<br>
  Everyone is permitted to copy and distribute verbatim copies<br>
  of this license document, but changing it is not allowed.</p>
<p> Preamble</p>
<p> The licenses for most software are designed to take away your<br>
  freedom to share and change it. By contrast, the GNU General Public<br>
  License is intended to guarantee your freedom to share and change free<br>
  software--to make sure the software is free for all its users. This<br>
  General Public License applies to most of the Free Software<br>
  Foundation's software and to any other program whose authors commit to<br>
  using it. (Some other Free Software Foundation software is covered by<br>
  the GNU Library General Public License instead.) You can apply it to<br>
  your programs, too.</p>
<p> When we speak of free software, we are referring to freedom, not<br>
  price. Our General Public Licenses are designed to make sure that you<br>
  have the freedom to distribute copies of free software (and charge for<br>
  this service if you wish), that you receive source code or can get it<br>
  if you want it, that you can change the software or use pieces of it<br>
  in new free programs; and that you know you can do these things.</p>
<p> To protect your rights, we need to make restrictions that forbid<br>
  anyone to deny you these rights or to ask you to surrender the rights.<br>
  These restrictions translate to certain responsibilities for you if you<br>
  distribute copies of the software, or if you modify it.</p>
<p> For example, if you distribute copies of such a program, whether<br>
  gratis or for a fee, you must give the recipients all the rights that<br>
  you have. You must make sure that they, too, receive or can get the<br>
  source code. And you must show them these terms so they know their<br>
  rights.</p>
<p> We protect your rights with two steps: (1) copyright the software, and<br>
  (2) offer you this license which gives you legal permission to copy,<br>
  distribute and/or modify the software.</p>
<p> Also, for each author's protection and ours, we want to make certain<br>
  that everyone understands that there is no warranty for this free<br>
  software. If the software is modified by someone else and passed on, we<br>
  want its recipients to know that what they have is not the original, so<br>
  that any problems introduced by others will not reflect on the original<br>
  authors' reputations.</p>
<p> Finally, any free program is threatened constantly by software<br>
  patents. We wish to avoid the danger that redistributors of a free<br>
  program will individually obtain patent licenses, in effect making the<br>
  program proprietary. To prevent this, we have made it clear that any<br>
  patent must be licensed for everyone's free use or not licensed at all.</p>
<p> The precise terms and conditions for copying, distribution and<br>
  modification follow.</p>
<p> GNU GENERAL PUBLIC LICENSE<br>
  TERMS AND CONDITIONS FOR COPYING, DISTRIBUTION AND MODIFICATION</p>
<p> 0. This License applies to any program or other work which contains<br>
  a notice placed by the copyright holder saying it may be distributed<br>
  under the terms of this General Public License. The &quot;Program&quot;, below,<br>
  refers to any such program or work, and a &quot;work based on the Program&quot;<br>
  means either the Program or any derivative work under copyright law:<br>
  that is to say, a work containing the Program or a portion of it,<br>
  either verbatim or with modifications and/or translated into another<br>
  language. (Hereinafter, translation is included without limitation in<br>
  the term &quot;modification&quot;.) Each licensee is addressed as &quot;you&quot;.</p>
<p>Activities other than copying, distribution and modification are not<br>
  covered by this License; they are outside its scope. The act of<br>
  running the Program is not restricted, and the output from the Program<br>
  is covered only if its contents constitute a work based on the<br>
  Program (independent of having been made by running the Program).<br>
  Whether that is true depends on what the Program does.</p>
<p> 1. You may copy and distribute verbatim copies of the Program's<br>
  source code as you receive it, in any medium, provided that you<br>
  conspicuously and appropriately publish on each copy an appropriate<br>
  copyright notice and disclaimer of warranty; keep intact all the<br>
  notices that refer to this License and to the absence of any warranty;<br>
  and give any other recipients of the Program a copy of this License<br>
  along with the Program.</p>
<p>You may charge a fee for the physical act of transferring a copy, and<br>
  you may at your option offer warranty protection in exchange for a fee.</p>
<p> 2. You may modify your copy or copies of the Program or any portion<br>
  of it, thus forming a work based on the Program, and copy and<br>
  distribute such modifications or work under the terms of Section 1<br>
  above, provided that you also meet all of these conditions:</p>
<p> a) You must cause the modified files to carry prominent notices<br>
  stating that you changed the files and the date of any change.</p>
<p> b) You must cause any work that you distribute or publish, that in<br>
  whole or in part contains or is derived from the Program or any<br>
  part thereof, to be licensed as a whole at no charge to all third<br>
  parties under the terms of this License.</p>
<p> c) If the modified program normally reads commands interactively<br>
  when run, you must cause it, when started running for such<br>
  interactive use in the most ordinary way, to print or display an<br>
  announcement including an appropriate copyright notice and a<br>
  notice that there is no warranty (or else, saying that you provide<br>
  a warranty) and that users may redistribute the program under<br>
  these conditions, and telling the user how to view a copy of this<br>
  License. (Exception: if the Program itself is interactive but<br>
  does not normally print such an announcement, your work based on<br>
  the Program is not required to print an announcement.)</p>
<p>These requirements apply to the modified work as a whole. If<br>
  identifiable sections of that work are not derived from the Program,<br>
  and can be reasonably considered independent and separate works in<br>
  themselves, then this License, and its terms, do not apply to those<br>
  sections when you distribute them as separate works. But when you<br>
  distribute the same sections as part of a whole which is a work based<br>
  on the Program, the distribution of the whole must be on the terms of<br>
  this License, whose permissions for other licensees extend to the<br>
  entire whole, and thus to each and every part regardless of who wrote it.</p>
<p>Thus, it is not the intent of this section to claim rights or contest<br>
  your rights to work written entirely by you; rather, the intent is to<br>
  exercise the right to control the distribution of derivative or<br>
  collective works based on the Program.</p>
<p>In addition, mere aggregation of another work not based on the Program<br>
  with the Program (or with a work based on the Program) on a volume of<br>
  a storage or distribution medium does not bring the other work under<br>
  the scope of this License.</p>
<p> 3. You may copy and distribute the Program (or a work based on it,<br>
  under Section 2) in object code or executable form under the terms of<br>
  Sections 1 and 2 above provided that you also do one of the following:</p>
<p> a) Accompany it with the complete corresponding machine-readable<br>
  source code, which must be distributed under the terms of Sections<br>
  1 and 2 above on a medium customarily used for software interchange; or,</p>
<p> b) Accompany it with a written offer, valid for at least three<br>
  years, to give any third party, for a charge no more than your<br>
  cost of physically performing source distribution, a complete<br>
  machine-readable copy of the corresponding source code, to be<br>
  distributed under the terms of Sections 1 and 2 above on a medium<br>
  customarily used for software interchange; or,</p>
<p> c) Accompany it with the information you received as to the offer<br>
  to distribute corresponding source code. (This alternative is<br>
  allowed only for noncommercial distribution and only if you<br>
  received the program in object code or executable form with such<br>
  an offer, in accord with Subsection b above.)</p>
<p>The source code for a work means the preferred form of the work for<br>
  making modifications to it. For an executable work, complete source<br>
  code means all the source code for all modules it contains, plus any<br>
  associated interface definition files, plus the scripts used to<br>
  control compilation and installation of the executable. However, as a<br>
  special exception, the source code distributed need not include<br>
  anything that is normally distributed (in either source or binary<br>
  form) with the major components (compiler, kernel, and so on) of the<br>
  operating system on which the executable runs, unless that component<br>
  itself accompanies the executable.</p>
<p>If distribution of executable or object code is made by offering<br>
  access to copy from a designated place, then offering equivalent<br>
  access to copy the source code from the same place counts as<br>
  distribution of the source code, even though third parties are not<br>
  compelled to copy the source along with the object code.</p>
<p> 4. You may not copy, modify, sublicense, or distribute the Program<br>
  except as expressly provided under this License. Any attempt<br>
  otherwise to copy, modify, sublicense or distribute the Program is<br>
  void, and will automatically terminate your rights under this License.<br>
  However, parties who have received copies, or rights, from you under<br>
  this License will not have their licenses terminated so long as such<br>
  parties remain in full compliance.</p>
<p> 5. You are not required to accept this License, since you have not<br>
  signed it. However, nothing else grants you permission to modify or<br>
  distribute the Program or its derivative works. These actions are<br>
  prohibited by law if you do not accept this License. Therefore, by<br>
  modifying or distributing the Program (or any work based on the<br>
  Program), you indicate your acceptance of this License to do so, and<br>
  all its terms and conditions for copying, distributing or modifying<br>
  the Program or works based on it.</p>
<p> 6. Each time you redistribute the Program (or any work based on the<br>
  Program), the recipient automatically receives a license from the<br>
  original licensor to copy, distribute or modify the Program subject to<br>
  these terms and conditions. You may not impose any further<br>
  restrictions on the recipients' exercise of the rights granted herein.<br>
  You are not responsible for enforcing compliance by third parties to<br>
  this License.</p>
<p> 7. If, as a consequence of a court judgment or allegation of patent<br>
  infringement or for any other reason (not limited to patent issues),<br>
  conditions are imposed on you (whether by court order, agreement or<br>
  otherwise) that contradict the conditions of this License, they do not<br>
  excuse you from the conditions of this License. If you cannot<br>
  distribute so as to satisfy simultaneously your obligations under this<br>
  License and any other pertinent obligations, then as a consequence you<br>
  may not distribute the Program at all. For example, if a patent<br>
  license would not permit royalty-free redistribution of the Program by<br>
  all those who receive copies directly or indirectly through you, then<br>
  the only way you could satisfy both it and this License would be to<br>
  refrain entirely from distribution of the Program.</p>
<p>If any portion of this section is held invalid or unenforceable under<br>
  any particular circumstance, the balance of the section is intended to<br>
  apply and the section as a whole is intended to apply in other<br>
  circumstances.</p>
<p>It is not the purpose of this section to induce you to infringe any<br>
  patents or other property right claims or to contest validity of any<br>
  such claims; this section has the sole purpose of protecting the<br>
  integrity of the free software distribution system, which is<br>
  implemented by public license practices. Many people have made<br>
  generous contributions to the wide range of software distributed<br>
  through that system in reliance on consistent application of that<br>
  system; it is up to the author/donor to decide if he or she is willing<br>
  to distribute software through any other system and a licensee cannot<br>
  impose that choice.</p>
<p>This section is intended to make thoroughly clear what is believed to<br>
  be a consequence of the rest of this License.</p>
<p> 8. If the distribution and/or use of the Program is restricted in<br>
  certain countries either by patents or by copyrighted interfaces, the<br>
  original copyright holder who places the Program under this License<br>
  may add an explicit geographical distribution limitation excluding<br>
  those countries, so that distribution is permitted only in or among<br>
  countries not thus excluded. In such case, this License incorporates<br>
  the limitation as if written in the body of this License.</p>
<p> 9. The Free Software Foundation may publish revised and/or new versions<br>
  of the General Public License from time to time. Such new versions will<br>
  be similar in spirit to the present version, but may differ in detail to<br>
  address new problems or concerns.</p>
<p>Each version is given a distinguishing version number. If the Program<br>
  specifies a version number of this License which applies to it and &quot;any<br>
  later version&quot;, you have the option of following the terms and conditions<br>
  either of that version or of any later version published by the Free<br>
  Software Foundation. If the Program does not specify a version number of<br>
  this License, you may choose any version ever published by the Free Software<br>
  Foundation.</p>
<p> 10. If you wish to incorporate parts of the Program into other free<br>
  programs whose distribution conditions are different, write to the author<br>
  to ask for permission. For software which is copyrighted by the Free<br>
  Software Foundation, write to the Free Software Foundation; we sometimes<br>
  make exceptions for this. Our decision will be guided by the two goals<br>
  of preserving the free status of all derivatives of our free software and<br>
  of promoting the sharing and reuse of software generally.</p>
<p> NO WARRANTY</p>
<p> 11. BECAUSE THE PROGRAM IS LICENSED FREE OF CHARGE, THERE IS NO WARRANTY<br>
  FOR THE PROGRAM, TO THE EXTENT PERMITTED BY APPLICABLE LAW. EXCEPT WHEN<br>
  OTHERWISE STATED IN WRITING THE COPYRIGHT HOLDERS AND/OR OTHER PARTIES<br>
  PROVIDE THE PROGRAM &quot;AS IS&quot; WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY KIND, EITHER
  EXPRESSED<br>
  OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING, BUT NOT LIMITED TO, THE IMPLIED WARRANTIES OF<br>
  MERCHANTABILITY AND FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE. THE ENTIRE RISK AS<br>
  TO THE QUALITY AND PERFORMANCE OF THE PROGRAM IS WITH YOU. SHOULD THE<br>
  PROGRAM PROVE DEFECTIVE, YOU ASSUME THE COST OF ALL NECESSARY SERVICING,<br>
  REPAIR OR CORRECTION.</p>
<p> 12. IN NO EVENT UNLESS REQUIRED BY APPLICABLE LAW OR AGREED TO IN WRITING<br>
  WILL ANY COPYRIGHT HOLDER, OR ANY OTHER PARTY WHO MAY MODIFY AND/OR<br>
  REDISTRIBUTE THE PROGRAM AS PERMITTED ABOVE, BE LIABLE TO YOU FOR DAMAGES,<br>
  INCLUDING ANY GENERAL, SPECIAL, INCIDENTAL OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES ARISING<br>
  OUT OF THE USE OR INABILITY TO USE THE PROGRAM (INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED<br>
  TO LOSS OF DATA OR DATA BEING RENDERED INACCURATE OR LOSSES SUSTAINED BY<br>
  YOU OR THIRD PARTIES OR A FAILURE OF THE PROGRAM TO OPERATE WITH ANY OTHER<br>
  PROGRAMS), EVEN IF SUCH HOLDER OR OTHER PARTY HAS BEEN ADVISED OF THE<br>
  POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES.</p>
<p> END OF TERMS AND CONDITIONS</p>
<p> How to Apply These Terms to Your New Programs</p>
<p> If you develop a new program, and you want it to be of the greatest<br>
  possible use to the public, the best way to achieve this is to make it<br>
  free software which everyone can redistribute and change under these terms.</p>
<p> To do so, attach the following notices to the program. It is safest<br>
  to attach them to the start of each source file to most effectively<br>
  convey the exclusion of warranty; and each file should have at least<br>
  the &quot;copyright&quot; line and a pointer to where the full notice is found.</p>
<p> &lt;one line to give the program's name and a brief idea of what it does.&gt;<br>
  Copyright (C) &lt;year&gt; &lt;name of author&gt;</p>
<p> This program is free software; you can redistribute it and/or modify<br>
  it under the terms of the GNU General Public License as published by<br>
  the Free Software Foundation; either version 2 of the License, or<br>
  (at your option) any later version.</p>
<p> This program is distributed in the hope that it will be useful,<br>
  but WITHOUT ANY WARRANTY; without even the implied warranty of<br>
  MERCHANTABILITY or FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE. See the<br>
  GNU General Public License for more details.</p>
<p> You should have received a copy of the GNU General Public License<br>
  along with this program; if not, write to the Free Software<br>
  Foundation, Inc., 59 Temple Place, Suite 330, Boston, MA 02111-1307 USA</p>
<p><br>
  Also add information on how to contact you by electronic and paper mail.</p>
<p>If the program is interactive, make it output a short notice like this<br>
  when it starts in an interactive mode:</p>
<p> Gnomovision version 69, Copyright (C) year name of author<br>
  Gnomovision comes with ABSOLUTELY NO WARRANTY; for details type `show w'.<br>
  This is free software, and you are welcome to redistribute it<br>
  under certain conditions; type `show c' for details.</p>
<p>The hypothetical commands `show w' and `show c' should show the appropriate<br>
  parts of the General Public License. Of course, the commands you use may<br>
  be called something other than `show w' and `show c'; they could even be<br>
  mouse-clicks or menu items--whatever suits your program.</p>
<p>You should also get your employer (if you work as a programmer) or your<br>
  school, if any, to sign a &quot;copyright disclaimer&quot; for the program,
  if<br>
  necessary. Here is a sample; alter the names:</p>
<p> Yoyodyne, Inc., hereby disclaims all copyright interest in the program<br>
  `Gnomovision' (which makes passes at compilers) written by James Hacker.</p>
<p> &lt;signature of Ty Coon&gt;, 1 April 1989<br>
  Ty Coon, President of Vice</p>
<p>This General Public License does not permit incorporating your program into<br>
  proprietary programs. If your program is a subroutine library, you may<br>
  consider it more useful to permit linking proprietary applications with the<br>
  library. If this is what you want to do, use the GNU Library General<br>
Public License instead of this License.</p>

Public License Version 0.5</p>


<p  >THE
ACCOMPANYING PROGRAM IS PROVIDED UNDER THE TERMS OF THIS COMMON PUBLIC LICENSE
(&quot;AGREEMENT&quot;). ANY USE, REPRODUCTION OR DISTRIBUTION OF THE PROGRAM
CONSTITUTES RECIPIENT'S ACCEPTANCE OF THIS AGREEMENT. </p>

<p  >1.
DEFINITIONS </p>

<p  >&quot;Contribution&quot;
means: </p>

<p   >a)
in the case of the initial Contributor, the initial code and documentation
distributed under this Agreement, and </p>

<p   >b)
in the case of each subsequent Contributor:</p>

<p   >i)
changes to the Program, and</p>

<p   >ii)
additions to the Program;</p>

<p   >where
such changes and/or additions to the Program originate from and are distributed
by that particular Contributor. A Contribution 'originates' from a Contributor
if it was added to the Program by such Contributor itself or anyone acting on
such Contributor's behalf. Contributions do not include additions to the
Program which: (i) are separate modules of software distributed in conjunction
with the Program under their own license agreement, and (ii) are not derivative
works of the Program.</p>

<p  >&quot;Contributor&quot;
means any person or entity that distributes the Program. </p>

<p  >&quot;Licensed
Patents &quot; mean patent claims licensable by a Contributor which are
necessarily infringed by the use or sale of its Contribution alone or when
combined with the Program. </p>

<p  >&quot;Program&quot;
means the Contributions distributed in accordance with this Agreement. </p>

<p  >&quot;Recipient&quot;
means anyone who receives the Program under this Agreement, including all
Contributors. </p>

<p  >2.
GRANT OF RIGHTS </p>

<p   >a)
Subject to the terms of this Agreement, each Contributor hereby grants
Recipient a non-exclusive, worldwide, royalty-free copyright license to
reproduce, prepare derivative works of, publicly display, publicly perform,
distribute and sublicense the Contribution of such Contributor, if any, and such
derivative works, in source code and object code form.</p>

<p   >b)
Subject to the terms of this Agreement, each Contributor hereby grants
Recipient a non-exclusive, worldwide, royalty-free patent license under
Licensed Patents to make, use, sell, offer to sell, import and otherwise
transfer the Contribution of such Contributor, if any, in source code and
object code form. This patent license shall apply to the combination of the
Contribution and the Program if, at the time the Contribution is added by the
Contributor, such addition of the Contribution causes such combination to be
covered by the Licensed Patents. The patent license shall not apply to any
other combinations which include the Contribution. No hardware per se is
licensed hereunder.</p>

<p   >c)
Recipient understands that although each Contributor grants the licenses to its
Contributions set forth herein, no assurances are provided by any Contributor
that the Program does not infringe the patent or other intellectual property
rights of any other entity. Each Contributor disclaims any liability to
Recipient for claims brought by any other entity based on infringement of
intellectual property rights or otherwise. As a condition to exercising the
rights and licenses granted hereunder, each Recipient hereby assumes sole
responsibility to secure any other intellectual property rights needed, if any.
For example, if a third party patent license is required to allow Recipient to
distribute the Program, it is Recipient's responsibility to acquire that
license before distributing the Program.</p>

<p   >d)
Each Contributor represents that to its knowledge it has sufficient copyright
rights in its Contribution, if any, to grant the copyright license set forth in
this Agreement. </p>

<p  >3.
REQUIREMENTS </p>

<p  >A
Contributor may choose to distribute the Program in object code form under its
own license agreement, provided that: </p>

<p   >a)
it complies with the terms and conditions of this Agreement; and</p>

<p   >b)
its license agreement:</p>

<p   >i)
effectively disclaims on behalf of all Contributors all warranties and conditions,
express and implied, including warranties or conditions of title and
non-infringement, and implied warranties or conditions of merchantability and
fitness for a particular purpose; </p>

<p   >ii)
effectively excludes on behalf of all Contributors all liability for damages,
including direct, indirect, special, incidental and consequential damages, such
as lost profits; </p>

<p   >iii)
states that any provisions which differ from this Agreement are offered by that
Contributor alone and not by any other party; and</p>

<p   >iv)
states that source code for the Program is available from such Contributor, and
informs licensees how to obtain it in a reasonable manner on or through a
medium customarily used for software exchange.</p>

<p  >When
the Program is made available in source code form: </p>

<p   >a)
it must be made available under this Agreement; and </p>

<p   >b)
a copy of this Agreement must be included with each copy of the Program. </p>

<p  >Contributors
may not remove or alter any copyright notices contained within the Program. </p>

<p  >Each
Contributor must identify itself as the originator of its Contribution, if any,
in a manner that reasonably allows subsequent Recipients to identify the
originator of the Contribution. </p>

<p  >4.
COMMERCIAL DISTRIBUTION </p>

<p  >Commercial
distributors of software may accept certain responsibilities with respect to
end users, business partners and the like. While this license is intended to
facilitate the commercial use of the Program, the Contributor who includes the
Program in a commercial product offering should do so in a manner which does
not create potential liability for other Contributors. Therefore, if a
Contributor includes the Program in a commercial product offering, such
Contributor (&quot;Commercial Contributor&quot;) hereby agrees to defend and
indemnify every other Contributor (&quot;Indemnified Contributor&quot;) against
any losses, damages and costs (collectively &quot;Losses&quot;) arising from
claims, lawsuits and other legal actions brought by a third party against the
Indemnified Contributor to the extent caused by the acts or omissions of such
Commercial Contributor in connection with its distribution of the Program in a
commercial product offering. The obligations in this section do not apply to
any claims or Losses relating to any actual or alleged intellectual property
infringement. In order to qualify, an Indemnified Contributor must: a) promptly
notify the Commercial Contributor in writing of such claim, and b) allow the
Commercial Contributor to control, and cooperate with the Commercial
Contributor in, the defense and any related settlement negotiations. The
Indemnified Contributor may participate in any such claim at its own expense. </p>

<p  >For
example, a Contributor might include the Program in a commercial product
offering, Product X. That Contributor is then a Commercial Contributor. If that
Commercial Contributor then makes performance claims, or offers warranties
related to Product X, those performance claims and warranties are such
Commercial Contributor's responsibility alone. Under this section, the Commercial
Contributor would have to defend claims against the other Contributors related
to those performance claims and warranties, and if a court requires any other
Contributor to pay any damages as a result, the Commercial Contributor must pay
those damages. </p>

<p  >5.
NO WARRANTY </p>

&quot;AS IS&quot; BASIS, WITHOUT WARRANTIES OR CONDITIONS OF ANY KIND, EITHER
EXPRESS OR IMPLIED INCLUDING, WITHOUT LIMITATION, ANY WARRANTIES OR CONDITIONS
OF TITLE, NON-INFRINGEMENT, MERCHANTABILITY OR FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR
PURPOSE. Each Recipient is solely responsible for determining the

DISCLAIMER OF LIABILITY </p>

<p  >EXCEPT
AS EXPRESSLY SET FORTH IN THIS AGREEMENT, NEITHER RECIPIENT NOR ANY
CONTRIBUTORS SHALL HAVE ANY LIABILITY FOR ANY DIRECT, INDIRECT, INCIDENTAL,
SPECIAL, EXEMPLARY, OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES (INCLUDING WITHOUT LIMITATION LOST
PROFITS), HOWEVER CAUSED AND ON ANY THEORY OF LIABILITY, WHETHER IN CONTRACT,

GENERAL </p>

<p  >If
any provision of this Agreement is invalid or unenforceable under applicable
law, it shall not affect the validity or enforceability of the remainder of the
terms of this Agreement, and without further action by the parties hereto, such
provision shall be reformed to the minimum extent necessary to make such
provision valid and enforceable. </p>

<p  >If
Recipient institutes patent litigation against a Contributor with respect to a
patent applicable to software (including a cross-claim or counterclaim in a
lawsuit), then any patent licenses granted by that Contributor to such
Recipient under this Agreement shall terminate as of the date such litigation
is filed. In addition, If Recipient institutes patent litigation against any
entity (including a cross-claim or counterclaim in a lawsuit) alleging that the
Program itself (excluding combinations of the Program with other software or
hardware) infringes such Recipient's patent(s), then such Recipient's rights
granted under Section 2(b) shall terminate as of the date such litigation is
filed. </p>

<p  >All
Recipient's rights under this Agreement shall terminate if it fails to comply
with any of the material terms or conditions of this Agreement and does not
cure such failure in a reasonable period of time after becoming aware of such
noncompliance. If all Recipient's rights under this Agreement terminate,
Recipient agrees to cease use and distribution of the Program as soon as
reasonably practicable. However, Recipient's obligations under this Agreement and
any licenses granted by Recipient relating to the Program shall continue and
survive. </p>

<p  >Everyone
is permitted to copy and distribute copies of this Agreement, but in order to
avoid inconsistency the Agreement is copyrighted and may only be modified in
the following manner. The Agreement Steward reserves the right to publish new
versions (including revisions) of this Agreement from time to time. No one
other than the Agreement Steward has the right to modify this Agreement. IBM is
the initial Agreement Steward. IBM may assign the responsibility to serve as
the Agreement Steward to a suitable separate entity. Each new version of the
Agreement will be given a distinguishing version number. The Program (including
Contributions) may always be distributed subject to the version of the
Agreement under which it was received. In addition, after a new version of the
Agreement is published, Contributor may elect to distribute the Program
(including its Contributions) under the new version. Except as expressly stated
in Sections 2(a) and 2(b) above, Recipient receives no rights or licenses to
the intellectual property of any Contributor under this Agreement, whether
expressly, by implication, estoppel or otherwise. All rights in the Program not
expressly granted under this Agreement are reserved. </p>

<p  >This
Agreement is governed by the laws of the State of New York and the intellectual
property laws of the United States of America. No party to this Agreement will
bring a legal action under this Agreement more than one year after the cause of
action arose. Each party waives its rights to a jury trial in any resulting
litigation. </p>

<p  >METRO
LINK PUBLIC LICENSE <br>
MOTIF GRAPHICAL USER INTERFACE SOFTWARE<br>
Version 1.00</p>

<p  align=center >THE
ACCOMPANYING PROGRAM IS PROVIDED UNDER THE TERMS OF THIS METRO LINK PUBLIC
LICENSE (&quot;AGREEMENT&quot;). ANY USE, REPRODUCTION OR DISTRIBUTION OF THE
PROGRAM CONSTITUTES RECIPIENT'S ACCEPTANCE OF THIS AGREEMENT. </p>

<p  >1.
DEFINITIONS </p>

<p  >&quot;Contribution&quot;
means: </p>

<p  >a.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
in the case of METRO LINK, INCORPORATED (&quot;METRO
LINK&quot;), the Metro Link Program, and </p>

<p  >b.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
in the case of each Contributor, </p>

<p>1.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
changes to the Program, and </p>

<p  >2.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
additions to the Program; </p>

<p  >where
such changes and/or additions to the Program originate from and are distributed
by that particular Contributor. A Contribution 'originates' from a Contributor
if it was added to the Program by such Contributor itself or anyone acting on
such Contributor's behalf. Contributions do not include additions to the
Program which: (i) are separate modules of software distributed in conjunction
with the Program under their own license agreement, and (ii) are not derivative
works of the Program. </p>

<p  >&quot;Contributor&quot;
means The Open Group, METRO LINK and any other entity that distributes the
Program. </p>

<p  >&quot;Licensed
Patents&quot; mean patent claims licensable by a Contributor which are
necessarily infringed by the use or sale of its Contribution alone or when
combined with the Program.</p>

<p  >&quot;Open
Source&quot; programs mean software for the source code is available without
confidential or trade secret restrictions and for which the source code and
object code are available for distribution without license charges.</p>

<p  >&quot;Metro
Link Program&quot; means the original version of the software accompanying this
Agreement as released by METRO LINK, including source code, object code and
documentation, if any. </p>

<p  >&quot;Program&quot;
means the Metro Link Program and Contributions. </p>

<p  >&quot;Recipient&quot;
means anyone who receives the Program under this Agreement, including all
Contributors. </p>

<p  >2.
GRANT OF RIGHTS </p>

<p  >The
rights granted under this license are limited solely to distribution and
sublicensing of the Contribution(s) on, with or for operating systems which are
themselves Open Source programs.</p>

<p  >a.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
Subject to the terms of this Agreement, The Open Group
Public License Agreement attached hereto (&quot;The Open Group Agreement&quot;) and the
limitations of this Section 2, each Contributor hereby grants Recipient a
non-exclusive, worldwide, royalty-free copyright license to reproduce, prepare
derivative works of, publicly display, publicly perform, distribute and
sublicense the Contribution of such Contributor, if any, and such derivative
works, in source code and object code form. </p>

<p  >b.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
Subject to the terms of this Agreement, The Open Group
Agreement and this Section 2, each Contributor hereby grants Recipient a
non-exclusive, worldwide, royalty-free patent license under Licensed Patents to
make, use, sell, offer to sell, import and otherwise transfer the Contribution
of such Contributor, if any, in source code and object code form. This patent
license shall apply to the combination of the Contribution and the Program if,
at the time the Contribution is added by the Contributor, such addition of the
Contribution causes such combination to be covered by the Licensed Patents. The
patent license shall not apply to any other combinations which include the
Contribution. No hardware per se is licensed hereunder. </p>

<p  >c.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
Recipient understands that although each Contributor grants
the licenses to its Contributions set forth herein, no assurances are provided
by any Contributor that the Program does not infringe the patent or other
intellectual property rights of any other entity. Each Contributor disclaims
any liability to Recipient for claims brought by any other entity based on
infringement of intellectual property rights or otherwise. As a condition to
exercising the rights and licenses granted hereunder, each Recipient hereby
assumes sole responsibility to secure any other intellectual property rights
needed, if any. For example, if a third party patent license is required to
allow Recipient to distribute the Program, it is Recipient's responsibility to
acquire that license before distributing the Program. </p>

<p  >d.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
Each Contributor represents that to its knowledge it has
sufficient copyright rights in its Contribution, if any, to grant the copyright
license set forth in this Agreement. </p>

<p  >3.
REQUIREMENTS </p>

<p  >A
Contributor may choose to distribute the Program in object code form under its
own license agreement, provided that: </p>

<p  >a.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
it complies with the terms and conditions of this Agreement
and The Open Group Agreement; and </p>

<p  >b.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
its license agreement: </p>

<p  >1.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
effectively disclaims on behalf of all Contributors all
warranties and conditions, express and implied, including warranties or
conditions of title and non-infringement, and implied warranties or conditions
of merchantability and fitness for a particular purpose; </p>

<p  >2.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
effectively excludes on behalf of all Contributors all
liability for damages, including direct, indirect, special, incidental and
consequential damages, such as lost profits; </p>

<p  >3.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
states that any provisions which differ from this Agreement
are offered by that Contributor alone and not by any other party; and </p>

<p  >4.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
states that source code for the Program is available from
such Contributor, and informs licensees how to obtain it in a reasonable manner
on or through a medium customarily used for software exchange. </p>

<p  >When
the Program is made available in source code form: </p>

<p  >a.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
it must be made available under this Agreement and the Open
Group Agreement; and </p>

<p  >b.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
a copy of this Agreement must be included with each copy of
the Program. </p>

<p  >Each
Contributor must include the following in a conspicuous location in the
Program: </p>

<p  >Copyright
(c) May, 2000 The Open Group, Metro Link, Incorporated and others. All Rights
Reserved</p>

<p  >In
addition, each Contributor must identify itself as the originator of its
Contribution, if any, in a manner that reasonably allows subsequent Recipients
to identify the originator of the Contribution. </p>

<p  >4.
COMMERCIAL DISTRIBUTION </p>

<p  >Commercial
distributors of software may accept certain responsibilities with respect to
end users, business partners and the like. While this license is intended to
facilitate the commercial use of the Program, the Contributor who includes the
Program in a commercial product offering should do so in a manner which does
not create potential liability for other Contributors. Therefore, if a
Contributor includes the Program in a commercial product offering, such
Contributor (&quot;Commercial Contributor&quot;) hereby agrees to defend and indemnify
every other Contributor (&quot;Indemnified Contributor&quot;) against any
losses, damages and costs (collectively &quot;Losses&quot;) arising from
claims, lawsuits and other legal actions brought by a third party against the
Indemnified Contributor to the extent caused by the acts or omissions of such
Commercial Contributor in connection with its distribution of the Program in a
commercial product offering. The obligations in this section do not apply to
any claims or Losses relating to any actual or alleged intellectual property
infringement. In order to qualify, an Indemnified Contributor must: </p>

<p  >a)
promptly notify the Commercial Contributor in writing of such claim, and </p>

<p  >b)
allow the Commercial Contributor to control, and cooperate with the Commercial
Contributor in, the defense and any related settlement negotiations. </p>

<p  >The
Indemnified Contributor may participate in any such claim at its own expense. </p>

<p  >For
example, a Contributor might include the Program in a commercial product
offering, Product X. That Contributor is then a Commercial Contributor. If that
Commercial Contributor then makes performance claims, or offers warranties
related to Product X, those performance claims and warranties are such
Commercial Contributor's responsibility alone. Under this section, the
Commercial Contributor would have to defend claims against the other
Contributors related to those performance claims and warranties, and if a court
requires any other Contributor to pay any damages as a result, the Commercial
Contributor must pay those damages. </p>

<p  >5. NO
WARRANTY </p>

<p  >EXCEPT
AS EXPRESSLY SET FORTH IN THIS AGREEMENT, THE PROGRAM IS PROVIDED ON AN
&quot;AS IS&quot; BASIS, WITHOUT WARRANTIES OR CONDITIONS OF ANY KIND, EITHER
EXPRESS OR IMPLIED INCLUDING, WITHOUT LIMITATION, ANY WARRANTIES OR CONDITIONS
OF TITLE, NON-INFRINGEMENT, MERCHANTABILITY OR FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR
PURPOSE. Each Recipient is solely responsible for determining the
appropriateness of using and distributing the Program and assumes all risks
associated with its exercise of rights under this Agreement, including but not
limited to the risks and costs of program errors, compliance with applicable
laws, damage to or loss of data, programs or equipment, and unavailability or
interruption of operations. </p>

<p  >6.
DISCLAIMER OF LIABILITY </p>

<p  >EXCEPT
AS EXPRESSLY SET FORTH IN THIS AGREEMENT, NEITHER RECIPIENT NOR ANY
CONTRIBUTORS SHALL HAVE ANY LIABILITY FOR ANY DIRECT, INDIRECT, INCIDENTAL,
SPECIAL, EXEMPLARY, OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES (INCLUDING WITHOUT LIMITATION LOST
PROFITS), HOWEVER CAUSED AND ON ANY THEORY OF LIABILITY, WHETHER IN CONTRACT,

STRICT LIABILITY, OR TORT (INCLUDING NEGLIGENCE OR OTHERWISE) ARISING IN ANY
WAY OUT OF THE USE OR DISTRIBUTION OF THE PROGRAM OR THE EXERCISE OF ANY RIGHTS
GRANTED HEREUNDER, EVEN IF ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES. </p>

<p  >7.
GENERAL </p>

<p  >If
any provision of this Agreement is invalid or unenforceable under applicable
law, it shall not affect the validity or enforceability of the remainder of the
terms of this Agreement, and without further action by the parties hereto, such
provision shall be reformed to the minimum extent necessary to make such
provision valid and enforceable. </p>

<p  >If
Recipient institutes patent litigation against a Contributor with respect to a
patent applicable to software (including a cross-claim or counterclaim in a
lawsuit), then any patent licenses granted by that Contributor to such
Recipient under this Agreement shall terminate as of the date such litigation
is filed. In addition, if Recipient institutes patent litigation against any
entity (including a cross-claim or counterclaim in a lawsuit) alleging that the
Program itself (excluding combinations of the Program with other software or
hardware) infringes such Recipient's patent(s), then such Recipient's rights
granted under Section 2(b) shall terminate as of the date such litigation is
filed. </p>

<p  >All
Recipient's rights under this Agreement shall terminate if it fails to comply
with any of the material terms or conditions of this Agreement and does not
cure such failure in a reasonable period of time after becoming aware of such
noncompliance. If all Recipient's rights under this Agreement terminate,
Recipient agrees to cease use and distribution of the Program as soon as
reasonably practicable. However, Recipient's obligations under this Agreement
and any licenses granted by Recipient relating to the Program shall continue
and survive. </p>

<p  >METRO
LINK may publish new versions (including revisions) of this Agreement from time
to time. Each new version of the Agreement will be given a distinguishing
version number. The Program (including Contributions) may always be distributed
subject to the version of the Agreement under which it was received. In
addition, after a new version of the Agreement is published, Contributor may
elect to distribute the Program (including its Contributions) under the new
version. No one other than METRO LINK has the right to modify this Agreement.
Except as expressly stated in Sections 2(a) and 2(b) above, Recipient receives
no rights or licenses to the intellectual property of any Contributor under
this Agreement, whether expressly, by implication, estoppel or otherwise. All
rights in the Program not expressly granted under this Agreement are reserved. </p>

<p  >This
Agreement is governed by the laws of the State of Florida and the intellectual
property laws of the United States of America. </p>

<p  >No
party to this Agreement will bring a legal action under this Agreement more
than one year after the cause of action arose. Each party waives its rights to
a jury trial in any resulting litigation.</p>

<p  >a.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
Subject to the terms of this Agreement and the limitations
of this Section 2, each Contributor hereby grants Recipient a non-exclusive,
worldwide, royalty-free copyright license to reproduce, prepare derivative
works of, publicly display, publicly perform, distribute and sublicense the
Contribution of such Contributor, if any, and such derivative works, in source
code and object code form. </p>

<p  >b.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
Subject to the terms of this Agreement and the limitations
of this Section 2, each Contributor hereby grants Recipient a non-exclusive,
worldwide, royalty-free patent license under Licensed Patents to make, use,
sell, offer to sell, import and otherwise transfer the Contribution of such
Contributor, if any, in source code and object code form. This patent license
shall apply to the combination of the Contribution and the Program if, at the
time the Contribution is added by the Contributor, such addition of the
Contribution causes such combination to be covered by the Licensed Patents. The
patent license shall not apply to any other combinations which include the
Contribution. No hardware per se is licensed hereunder. </p>

Recipient understands that although each Contributor
grants the licenses to its Contributions set forth herein, no assurances are
provided by any Contributor that the Program does not infringe the patent or
other intellectual property rights of any other entity. Each Contributor disclaims
any liability to Recipient for claims brought by any other entity based on
infringement of intellectual property rights or otherwise. As a condition to
exercising the rights and licenses granted hereunder, each Recipient hereby
assumes sole responsibility to secure any other intellectual property rights
needed, if any. For example, if a third party patent license is required to
allow Recipient to distribute the Program, it is Recipient's responsibility to
acquire that license before distributing the Program. </p>

<p  >d.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
Each Contributor represents that to its knowledge it has
sufficient copyright rights in its Contribution, if any, to grant the copyright
license set forth in this Agreement. </p>

<p  >3.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
<b>REQUIREMENTS</b> </p>

<p  >A
Contributor may choose to distribute the Program in object code form under its
own license agreement, provided that:</p>

<p  >a.
it complies with the terms and conditions of this Agreement; and</p>

<p  >b.
its license agreement:</p>

<p  >i.
effectively disclaims on behalf of all Contributors all warranties and

a copy of this Agreement must be included with each copy of the Program.</p>

<p  >Each
Contributor must include the following in a conspicuous location in the
Program:</p>

<p  >Copyright
(c) {date here}, The Open Group Ltd. and others. All Rights Reserved.</p>

<p  >In
addition, each Contributor must identify itself as the originator of its
Contribution, if any, in a manner that reasonably allows subsequent Recipients
to identify the originator of the Contribution.</p>

<p  >4.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
<b>COMMERCIAL DISTRIBUTION</b> </p>

<p  >Commercial
distributors of software may accept certain responsibilities with respect to
end users, business partners and the like. While this license is intended to
facilitate the commercial use of the Program, subject to the limitations
provided in Section 2, the Contributor who includes the Program in a commercial
product offering should do so in a manner which does not create potential
liability for other Contributors. Therefore, if a Contributor includes the
Program in a commercial product offering, such Contributor (&quot;Commercial
Contributor&quot;) hereby agrees to defend and indemnify every other
Contributor (&quot;Indemnified Contributor&quot;) against any losses, damages
and costs (collectively &quot;Losses&quot;) arising from claims, lawsuits and
other legal actions brought by a third party against the Indemnified
Contributor to the extent caused by the acts or omissions of such Commercial
Contributor in connection with its distribution of the Program in a commercial
product offering. The obligations in this section do not apply to any claims or
Losses relating to any actual or alleged intellectual property infringement. In
order to qualify, an Indemnified Contributor must:</p>

<p  >a.
promptly notify the Commercial Contributor in writing of such claim, and</p>

<p  >b.
allow the Commercial Contributor to control, and cooperate with the Commercial
Contributor in, the defence and any related settlement negotiations.</p>

<p  >The
Indemnified Contributor may participate in any such claim at its own expense.</p>

<p  >For
example, a Contributor might include the Program in a commercial product
offering, Product X. That Contributor is then a Commercial Contributor. If that
Commercial Contributor then makes performance claims, or offers warranties
related to Product X, those performance claims and warranties are such
Commercial Contributor's responsibility alone. Under this section, the
Commercial Contributor would have to defend claims against the other
Contributors related to those performance claims and warranties, and if a court
requires any other Contributor to pay any damages as a result, the Commercial
Contributor must pay those damages.</p>

AS EXPRESSLY SET FORTH IN THIS AGREEMENT, THE PROGRAM IS PROVIDED ON AN
&quot;AS IS&quot; BASIS, WITHOUT WARRANTIES OR CONDITIONS OF ANY KIND, EITHER
EXPRESS OR IMPLIED INCLUDING, WITHOUT LIMITATION, ANY WARRANTIES OR CONDITIONS
OF TITLE, NON-INFRINGEMENT, MERCHANTABILITY OR FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR
PURPOSE. Each Recipient is solely responsible for determining the appropriateness
of using and distributing the Program and assumes all risks associated with its
exercise of rights under this Agreement, including but not limited to the risks
and costs of program errors, compliance with applicable laws, damage to or loss
of data, programs or equipment, and unavailability or interruption of

<b>GENERAL</b> </p>

<p  >If
any provision of this Agreement is invalid or unenforceable under applicable
law, it shall not affect the validity or enforceability of the remainder of the
terms of this Agreement, and without further action by the parties hereto, such
provision shall be reformed to the minimum extent necessary to make such
provision valid and enforceable.</p>

<p  >If
Recipient institutes patent litigation or other similar official proceedings to
enforce patent rights against a Contributor with respect to a patent applicable
to software (including a cross-claim or counterclaim in a lawsuit), then any
patent licenses granted by that Contributor to such Recipient under this
Agreement shall terminate as of the date such litigation is filed. In addition,
If Recipient institutes patent litigation against any entity (including a
cross-claim or counterclaim in a lawsuit) alleging that the Program itself
(excluding combinations of the Program with other software or hardware)
infringes such Recipient's patent(s), then such Recipient's rights granted
under Section 2(b) shall terminate as of the date such litigation is filed.</p>

<p  >All
Recipient's rights under this Agreement shall terminate if it fails to comply
with any of the material terms or conditions of this Agreement and does not
cure such failure in a reasonable period of time after becoming aware of such
non-compliance. If all Recipient's rights under this Agreement terminate,
Recipient agrees to cease use and distribution of the Program as soon as
reasonably practicable. However, Recipient's obligations under this Agreement
and any licenses granted by Recipient relating to the Program shall continue
and survive.</p>

<p  >The
Open Group may publish new versions (including revisions) of this Agreement
from time to time. Each new version of the Agreement will be given a
distinguishing version number. The Program (including Contributions) may always
be distributed subject to the version of the Agreement under which it was
received. In addition, after a new version of the Agreement is published,
Contributor may elect to distribute the Program (including its Contributions)
under the new version. No one other than The Open Group has the right to modify
this Agreement. Except as expressly stated in Sections 2(a) and 2(b) above,
Recipient receives no rights or licenses to the intellectual property of any
Contributor under this Agreement, whether expressly, by implication, estoppel
or otherwise. All rights in the Program not expressly granted under this
Agreement are reserved.</p>

<p  >No
party to this Agreement will bring a legal action under this Agreement more
than one year after the cause of action arose. Each party waives its rights to
a jury trial in any resulting litigation.</p>

<p class=preformatted >FFor those of you that choose to use the GNU General Public
License, my interpretation of the GNU General Public License is that no Perl
script falls under the terms of the GPL unless you explicitly put said script
under the terms of the GPL yourself.  Furthermore, any object code linked
with perl does not automatically fall under the terms of the GPL, provided such
object code only adds definitions of subroutines and variables, and does not
otherwise impair the resulting interpreter from executing any standard Perl
script.  I consider linking in C subroutines in this manner to be the
moral equivalent of defining subroutines in the Perl language itself.  You
may sell such an object file as proprietary provided that you provide&nbsp; or
offer to provide the Perl source, as specified by the GNU General Public
License.  (This is merely an alternate way of specifying input to the
program.)&nbsp; You may also sell a binary produced by the dumping of a running
Perl script that belongs to you, provided that you provide or offer to provide
the Perl source as specified by the GPL.  (The fact that a Perl
interpreter and your code are in the same binary file is, in this case, a form
of mere aggregation.)&nbsp; This is my interpretation of the GPL.  If you
still have concerns or difficulties understanding my intent, feel free to
contact me.  Of course, the Artistic License spells all this out for your
protection, so you may prefer to use that. &nbsp;</p>

<p class=h3 >Preamble</p>

<p  >The
intent of this document is to state the conditions under which a Package may be
copied, such that the Copyright Holder maintains some semblance of artistic
control over the development of the package, while giving the users of the
package the right to use and distribute the Package in a more-or-less customary
fashion, plus the right to make reasonable modifications. </p>

<p class=h3 >Definitions</p>

<p class=blockquote >&quot;Package&quot;
refers to the collection of files distributed by the Copyright Holder, and
derivatives of that collection of files created through textual modification. </p>

<p class=blockquote >&quot;Standard
Version&quot; refers to such a Package if it has not been modified, or has been
modified in accordance with the wishes of the Copyright Holder as specified
below. </p>

<p class=blockquote >&quot;Copyright
Holder&quot; is whoever is named in the copyright or copyrights for the
package. </p>

<p class=blockquote >&quot;You&quot; is
you, if you're thinking about copying or distributing this Package. </p>

<p class=blockquote >&quot;Reasonable
copying fee&quot; is whatever you can justify on the basis of media cost,
duplication charges, time of people involved, and so on. (You will not be
required to justify it to the Copyright Holder, but only to the computing
community at large as a market that must bear the fee.) </p>

<p class=blockquote >&quot;Freely
Available&quot; means that no fee is charged for the item itself, though there
may be fees involved in handling the item. It also means that recipients of the
item may redistribute it under the same conditions they received it. </p>

<p  >You
may make and give away verbatim copies of the source form of the Standard
Version of this Package without restriction, provided that you duplicate all of
the original copyright notices and associated disclaimers. </p>

<p  >You
may apply bug fixes, portability fixes and other modifications derived from the
Public Domain or from the Copyright Holder. A Package modified in such a way
shall still be considered the Standard Version. </p>

<p  >You
may otherwise modify your copy of this Package in any way, provided that you
insert a prominent notice in each changed file stating how and when you changed
that file, and provided that you do at least ONE of the following: </p>

<p  >place
your modifications in the Public Domain or otherwise make them Freely
Available, such as by posting said modifications to Usenet or an equivalent
medium, or placing the modifications on a major archive site such as
uunet.uu.net, or by allowing the Copyright Holder to include your modifications
in the Standard Version of the Package. </p>

<p  >use
the modified Package only within your corporation or organization. </p>

<p  >rename
any non-standard executables so the names do not conflict with standard executables,
which must also be provided, and provide a separate manual page for each
non-standard executable that clearly documents how it differs from the Standard
Version. </p>

<p  >make
other distribution arrangements with the Copyright Holder. </p>

<p  >You
may distribute the programs of this Package in object code or executable form,
provided that you do at least ONE of the following: </p>

<p  >distribute
a Standard Version of the executables and library files, together with
instructions (in the manual page or equivalent) on where to get the Standard
Version. </p>

<p  >accompany
the distribution with the machine-readable source of the Package with your
modifications. </p>

<p  >give
non-standard executables non-standard names, and clearly document the
differences in manual pages (or equivalent), together with instructions on
where to get the Standard Version. </p>

<p  >make
other distribution arrangements with the Copyright Holder. </p>

<p  >You
may charge a reasonable copying fee for any distribution of this Package. You
may charge any fee you choose for support of this Package. You may not charge a
fee for this Package itself. However, you may distribute this Package in
aggregate with other (possibly commercial) programs as part of a larger
(possibly commercial) software distribution provided that you do not advertise
this Package as a product of your own. You may embed this Package's interpreter
within an executable of yours (by linking); this shall be construed as a mere
form of aggregation, provided that the complete Standard Version of the
interpreter is so embedded. </p>

<p  >The
scripts and library files supplied as input to or produced as output from the
programs of this Package do not automatically fall under the copyright of this
Package, but belong to whomever generated them, and may be sold commercially,
and may be aggregated with this Package. If such scripts or library files are
aggregated with this Package via the so-called &quot;undump&quot; or
&quot;unexec&quot; methods of producing a binary executable image, then
distribution of such an image shall neither be construed as a distribution of
this Package nor shall it fall under the restrictions of Paragraphs 3 and 4,
provided that you do not represent such an executable image as a Standard
Version of this Package. </p>

<p  >C
subroutines (or comparably compiled subroutines in other languages) supplied by
you and linked into this Package in order to emulate subroutines and variables
of the language defined by this Package shall not be considered part of this
Package, but are the equivalent of input as in Paragraph 6, provided these
subroutines do not change the language in any way that would cause it to fail
the regression tests for the language. </p>

<p  >Aggregation
of this Package with a commercial distribution is always permitted provided
that the use of this Package is embedded; that is, when no overt attempt is
made to make this Package's interfaces visible to the end user of the
commercial distribution. Such use shall not be construed as a distribution of
this Package. </p>

<p  >The
name of the Copyright Holder may not be used to endorse or promote products
derived from this software without specific prior written permission. </p>

<p  >THIS
PACKAGE IS PROVIDED &quot;AS IS&quot; AND WITHOUT ANY EXPRESS OR IMPLIED
WARRANTIES, INCLUDING, WITHOUT LIMITATION, THE IMPLIED WARRANTIES OF
MERCHANTIBILITY AND FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE. </p>

designated software packages--typically libraries--of the Free Software
Foundation and other authors who decide to use it.  You can use it too,
but we suggest you first think carefully about whether this license or the
ordinary General Public License is the better strategy to use in any particular
case, based on the explanations below. </p>

<p  >&nbsp;
When we speak of free software, we are referring to freedom of use, not
price.  Our General Public Licenses are designed to make sure that you
have the freedom to distribute copies of free software (and charge for this
service if you wish); that you receive source code or can get it if you want
it; that you can change the software and use pieces of it in new free programs;
and that you are informed that you can do these things. </p>

<p  >&nbsp;
To protect your rights, we need to make restrictions that forbid distributors
to deny you these rights or to ask you to surrender these rights.  These restrictions
translate to certain responsibilities for you if you distribute copies of the
library or if you modify it. </p>

<p  >&nbsp;
For example, if you distribute copies of the library, whether gratis or for a
fee, you must give the recipients all the rights that we gave you.  You
must make sure that they, too, receive or can get the source code.  If you
link other code with the library, you must provide complete object files to the
recipients, so that they can relink them with the library after making changes
to the library and recompiling it.  And you must show them these terms so
they know their rights. </p>

<p  >&nbsp;
We protect your rights with a two-step method: (1) we copyright the library,
and (2) we offer you this license, which gives you legal permission to copy,
distribute and/or modify the library. </p>

<p  >&nbsp;
To protect each distributor, we want to make it very clear that there is no
warranty for the free library.  Also, if the library is modified by
someone else and passed on, the recipients should know that what they have is
not the original version, so that the original author's reputation will not be
affected by problems that might be introduced by others. </p>

<p  >&nbsp;
Finally, software patents pose a constant threat to the existence of any free
program.  We wish to make sure that a company cannot effectively restrict
the users of a free program by obtaining a restrictive license from a patent
holder.  Therefore, we insist that any patent license obtained for a
version of the library must be consistent with the full freedom of use specified
in this license. </p>

<p  >&nbsp;
Most GNU software, including some libraries, is covered by the ordinary GNU
General Public License.  This license, the GNU Lesser General Public
License, applies to certain designated libraries, and is quite different from
the ordinary General Public License.  We use this license for certain
libraries in order to permit linking those libraries into non-free
programs. </p>

<p  >&nbsp;
When a program is linked with a library, whether statically or using a shared
library, the combination of the two is legally speaking a combined work, a
derivative of the original library.  The ordinary General Public License
therefore permits such linking only if the entire combination fits its criteria
of freedom.  The Lesser General Public License permits more lax criteria
for linking other code with the library. </p>

<p  >&nbsp;
We call this license the &quot;Lesser&quot; General Public License because it
does Less to protect the user's freedom than the ordinary General Public
License.  It also provides other free software developers Less of an
advantage over competing non-free programs.  These disadvantages are the
reason we use the ordinary General&nbsp; Public License for many
libraries.  However, the Lesser license provides advantages in certain
special circumstances. </p>

<p  >&nbsp;
For example, on rare occasions, there may be a special need to encourage the
widest possible use of a certain library, so that it becomes a de-facto
standard.  To achieve this, non-free programs must be allowed to use the
library.  A more frequent case is that a free library does the same job as
widely used non-free libraries.  In&nbsp; this case, there is little to
gain by limiting the free library to free software only, so we use the Lesser
General Public License. </p>

<p  >&nbsp;
In other cases, permission to use a particular library in non-free programs
enables a greater number of people to use a large body of free software. 
For example, permission to use the GNU C Library in non-free programs enables
many more people to use the whole GNU operating system, as well as its variant,
the GNU/Linux operating system. </p>

<p  >&nbsp;
Although the Lesser General Public License is Less protective of the users'
freedom, it does ensure that the user of a program that is linked with the
Library has the freedom and the wherewithal to run that program using a
modified version of the Library. </p>

<p  >&nbsp;
The precise terms and conditions for copying, distribution and modification
follow.  Pay close attention to the difference between a &quot;work based
on the library&quot; and a &quot;work that uses the library&quot;.  The
former contains code derived from the library, whereas the latter must be
combined with the library in order to run.</p>

<p  >&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
GNU LESSER GENERAL PUBLIC LICENSE</p>

<p  >&nbsp;&nbsp;
TERMS AND CONDITIONS FOR COPYING, DISTRIBUTION AND MODIFICATION</p>

<p  >&nbsp;
0. This License Agreement applies to any software library or other program
which contains a notice placed by the copyright holder or other authorized
party saying it may be distributed under the terms of this Lesser General
Public License (also called &quot;this License&quot;). Each licensee is
addressed as &quot;you&quot;. </p>

<p  >&nbsp;
A &quot;library&quot; means a collection of software functions and/or data
prepared so as to be conveniently linked with application programs (which use
some of those functions and data) to form executables. </p>

<p  >&nbsp;
The &quot;Library&quot;, below, refers to any such software library or work
which has been distributed under these terms.  A &quot;work based on the
Library&quot; means either the Library or any derivative work under copyright
law: that is to say, a work containing the Library or a portion of it, either
verbatim or with modifications and/or translated straightforwardly into another
language.  (Hereinafter, translation is included without limitation in the
term &quot;modification&quot;.) &nbsp;</p>

<p  >&nbsp;
&quot;Source code&quot; for a work means the preferred form of the work for
making modifications to it.  For a library, complete source code means all
the source code for all modules it contains, plus any associated interface
definition files, plus the scripts used to control compilation and installation
of the library. </p>

<p  >&nbsp;
Activities other than copying, distribution and modification are not covered by
this License; they are outside its scope.  The act of running a program
using the Library is not restricted, and output from such a program is covered
only if its contents constitute a work based on the Library (independent of the
use of the Library in a tool for writing it).  Whether that is true
depends on what the Library does and what the program that uses the Library
does.  </p>

<p  >&nbsp;
1. You may copy and distribute verbatim copies of the Library's complete source
code as you receive it, in any medium, provided that you conspicuously and
appropriately publish on each copy an appropriate copyright notice and
disclaimer of warranty; keep intact all the notices that refer to this License
and to the absence of any warranty; and distribute a copy of this License along
with the Library. </p>

<p  >&nbsp;
You may charge a fee for the physical act of transferring a copy, and you may
at your option offer warranty protection in exchange for a fee.</p>

<p  >&nbsp;
2. You may modify your copy or copies of the Library or any portion of it, thus
forming a work based on the Library, and copy and distribute such modifications
or work under the terms of Section 1 above, provided that you also meet all of
these conditions: </p>

<p  >&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
a) The modified work must itself be a software library.</p>

<p  >&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
b) You must cause the files modified to carry prominent notices stating that
you changed the files and the date of any change.</p>

<p  >&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
c) You must cause the whole of the work to be licensed at no charge to all
third parties under the terms of this License.</p>

<p  >&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
d) If a facility in the modified Library refers to a function or a&nbsp; table of
data to be supplied by an application program that uses the facility, other
than as an argument passed when the facility&nbsp; is invoked, then you must
make a good faith effort to ensure that, in the event an application does not
supply such function or table, the facility still operates, and performs
whatever part of its purpose remains meaningful. </p>

<p  >&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
(For example, a function in a library to compute square roots has a purpose
that is entirely well-defined independent of the application.  Therefore,
Subsection 2d requires that any application-supplied function or table used by
this function must be optional: if the application does not supply it, the
square root function must still compute square roots.)</p>

<p  >These
requirements apply to the modified work as a whole.  If identifiable
sections of that work are not derived from the Library,&nbsp; and can be
reasonably considered independent and separate works in themselves, then this
License, and its terms, do not apply to those sections when you distribute them
as separate works.  But when you distribute the same sections as part of a
whole which is a work based on the Library, the distribution of the whole must
be on the terms of this License, whose permissions for other licensees extend
to the entire whole, and thus to each and every part regardless of who wrote
it. </p>

<p  >Thus,
it is not the intent of this section to claim rights or contest your rights to
work written entirely by you; rather, the intent is to exercise the right to
control the&nbsp; distribution of derivative or collective works based on the
Library. </p>

<p  >In
addition, mere aggregation of another work not based on the Library with the
Library (or with a work based on the Library) on a volume of a storage or
distribution medium does not bring the other work under the scope of this
License. </p>

<p  >&nbsp;
3. You may opt to apply the terms of the ordinary GNU General Public License
instead of this License to a given copy of the Library.  To do this, you
must alter all the notices that refer to this License, so that they refer to
the ordinary GNU General Public License, version 2, instead of to this
License.  (If a newer version than version 2 of the ordinary GNU General
Public License has appeared, then you can specify that version instead if you
wish.)&nbsp; Do not make any other change in these notices. </p>

<p  >&nbsp;
Once this change is made in a given copy, it is irreversible for that copy, so
the ordinary GNU General Public License applies to all subsequent copies and
derivative works made from that copy. </p>

<p  >&nbsp;
This option is useful when you wish to copy part of the code of the Library
into a program that is not a library.</p>

<p  >&nbsp;
4. You may copy and distribute the Library (or a portion or derivative of it,
under Section 2) in object code or executable form under the terms of Sections
1 and 2 above provided that you accompany it with the complete corresponding
machine-readable source code, which must be distributed under the terms of
Sections 1 and 2 above on a medium customarily used for software interchange. </p>

<p  >&nbsp;
If distribution of object code is made by offering access to copy from a
designated place, then offering equivalent access to copy the source code from
the same place satisfies the requirement to distribute the source code, even
though third parties are not compelled to copy the source along with the object
code. </p>

<p  >&nbsp;
5. A program that contains no derivative of any portion of the Library, but is
designed to work with the Library by being compiled or linked with it, is
called a &quot;work that uses the Library&quot;.  Such a work, in
isolation, is not a derivative work of the Library, and therefore falls outside
the scope of this License. </p>

<p  >&nbsp;
However, linking a &quot;work that uses the Library&quot; with the Library
creates an executable that is a derivative of the Library (because it contains
portions of the Library), rather than a &quot;work that uses the
library&quot;.  The executable is therefore covered by this License.
Section 6 states terms for distribution of such executables. </p>

<p  >&nbsp;
When a &quot;work that uses the Library&quot; uses material from a header file
that is part of the Library, the object code for the work may be a derivative
work of the Library even though the source code is not. Whether this is true is
especially significant if the work can be linked without the Library, or if the
work is itself a library.  The threshold for this to be true is not
precisely defined by law. </p>

<p  >&nbsp;
If such an object file uses only numerical parameters, data structure layouts
and accessors, and small macros and small inline functions (ten lines or less
in length), then the use of the object file is unrestricted, regardless of
whether it is legally a derivative work.  (Executables containing this
object code plus portions of the Library will still fall under Section 6.)
&nbsp;</p>

<p  >&nbsp;
Otherwise, if the work is a derivative of the Library, you may distribute the
object code for the work under the terms of Section 6. Any executables
containing that work also fall under Section 6, whether or not they are linked
directly with the Library itself. </p>

<p  >&nbsp;
6. As an exception to the Sections above, you may also combine or link a
&quot;work that uses the Library&quot; with the Library to produce a work
containing portions of the Library, and distribute that work under terms of
your choice, provided that the terms permit modification of the work for the
customer's own use and reverse engineering for debugging such modifications. </p>

<p  >&nbsp;
You must give prominent notice with each copy of the work that the Library is
used in it and that the Library and its use are covered by this License. 
You must supply a copy of this License.  If the work during execution
displays copyright notices, you must include the copyright notice for the
Library among them, as well as a reference directing the user to the copy of
this License.  Also, you must do one of these things:&nbsp;</p>

<p  >&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
a) Accompany the work with the complete corresponding machine-readable source
code for the Library including whatever changes were used in the work (which
must be distributed under Sections 1 and 2 above); and, if the work is an
executable linked with the Library, with the complete machine-readable
&quot;work that uses the Library&quot;, as object code and/or source code, so
that the user can modify the Library and then relink to produce a modified
executable containing the modified Library. (It is understood that the
user who changes the contents of definitions files in the Library will not
necessarily be able to recompile the application to use the modified
definitions.)&nbsp;</p>

<p  >&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
b) Use a suitable shared library mechanism for linking with the Library. 
A suitable mechanism is one that (1) uses at run time a copy of the library
already present on the user's computer system,&nbsp; rather than copying
library functions into the executable, and (2)&nbsp; will operate properly with
a modified version of the library, if the user installs one, as long as the modified
version is interface-compatible with the version that the work was made
with. </p>

<p  >&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
c) Accompany the work with a written offer, valid for at&nbsp; least three
years, to give the same user the materials specified in Subsection 6a, above,
for a charge no more than the cost of performing this distribution.</p>

<p  >&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
d) If distribution of the work is made by offering access to copy from a
designated place, offer equivalent access to copy the above specified materials
from the same place.</p>

<p  >&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
e) Verify that the user has already received a copy of these materials or that
you have already sent this user a copy. </p>

<p  >&nbsp;
For an executable, the required form of the &quot;work that uses the
Library&quot; must include any data and utility programs needed for reproducing
the executable from it. However, as a special exception, the materials to
be distributed need not include anything that is normally distributed (in
either source or binary form) with the major components (compiler, kernel, and
so on) of the operating system on which the executable runs, unless that
component itself accompanies the executable. </p>

<p  >&nbsp;
It may happen that this requirement contradicts the license restrictions of
other proprietary libraries that do not normally accompany the operating
system.  Such a contradiction means you cannot use both them and the
Library together in an executable that you distribute. </p>

<p  >&nbsp;
7. You may place library facilities that are a work based on the Library
side-by-side in a single library together with other library facilities not
covered by this License, and distribute such a combined library, provided that
the separate distribution of the work based on the Library and of the other
library facilities is otherwise permitted,&nbsp; and provided that you do these
two things:&nbsp;</p>

<p  >&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
a) Accompany the combined library with a copy of the same work based on the
Library, uncombined with any other library&nbsp; facilities.  This must be
distributed under the terms of the Sections above.</p>

<p  >&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
b) Give prominent notice with the combined library of the fact that part of it
is a work based on the Library, and explaining&nbsp; where to find the
accompanying uncombined form of the same work.</p>

<p  >&nbsp;
8. You may not copy, modify, sublicense, link with, or distribute the Library
except as expressly provided under this License.  Any attempt otherwise to
copy, modify, sublicense, link with, or distribute the Library is void, and
will automatically terminate your rights under this License.  However,
parties who have received copies, or rights, from you under this License will
not have their licenses terminated so long as such parties remain in full
compliance. </p>

<p  >&nbsp;
9. You are not required to accept this License, since you have not signed
it.  However, nothing else grants you permission to modify or distribute
the Library or its derivative works.  These actions are prohibited by law
if you do not accept this License.  Therefore, by modifying or
distributing the Library (or any work based on the Library), you indicate your
acceptance of this License to do so, and&nbsp; all its terms and conditions for
copying, distributing or modifying the Library or works based on it. </p>

<p  >&nbsp;
10. Each time you redistribute the Library (or any work based on the Library),
the recipient automatically receives a license from the original licensor to
copy, distribute, link with or modify the Library subject to these terms and
conditions.  You may not impose any further restrictions on the
recipients' exercise of the rights granted herein. You are not responsible for
enforcing compliance by third parties with this License. </p>

<p  >&nbsp;
11. If, as a consequence of a court judgment or allegation of patent
infringement or for any other reason (not limited to patent issues), conditions
are imposed on you (whether by court order, agreement or otherwise) that
contradict the conditions of this License, they do not excuse you from the
conditions of this License.  If you cannot distribute so as to satisfy
simultaneously your obligations under this License and any other pertinent
obligations, then as a consequence you may not distribute the Library at
all.  For example, if a patent license would not permit royalty-free
redistribution of the Library by all those who receive copies directly or
indirectly through you, then the only way you could satisfy both it and this
License would be to refrain entirely from distribution of the Library. </p>

<p  >If
any portion of this section is held invalid or unenforceable under any
particular circumstance, the balance of the section is intended to apply, and
the section as a whole is intended to apply in other circumstances. </p>

<p  >It
is not the purpose of this section to induce you to infringe any patents or
other property right claims or to contest validity of any such claims; this
section has the sole purpose of protecting the integrity of the free software distribution
system which is implemented by public license practices.  Many people have
made generous contributions to the wide range of software distributed through
that system in reliance on consistent application of that system; it is up to
the author/donor to decide if he or she is willing to distribute software
through any other system and a licensee cannot impose that choice. </p>

<p  >This
section is intended to make thoroughly clear what is believed to be a
consequence of the rest of this License. </p>

<p  >&nbsp;
12. If the distribution and/or use of the Library is restricted in certain
countries either by patents or by copyrighted interfaces, the original
copyright holder who places the Library under this License may add an explicit
geographical distribution limitation excluding those countries, so that
distribution is permitted only in or among countries not thus excluded. 
In such case, this License incorporates the limitation as if written in the
body of this License. </p>

<p  >&nbsp;
13. The Free Software Foundation may publish revised and/or new versions of the
Lesser General Public License from time to time. Such new versions will be
similar in spirit to the present version, but may differ in detail to address
new problems or concerns. </p>

<p  >Each
version is given a distinguishing version number.  If the Library
specifies a version number of this License which applies to it and &quot;any
later version&quot;, you have the option of following the terms and conditions
either of that version or of any later version published by the Free Software
Foundation.  If the Library does not specify a license version number, you
may choose any version ever published by the Free Software Foundation. </p>

<p  >&nbsp;
14. If you wish to incorporate parts of the Library into other free programs
whose distribution conditions are incompatible with these, write to the author
to ask for permission.  For software which is copyrighted by the Free
Software Foundation, write to the Free Software Foundation; we sometimes make
exceptions for this.  Our decision will be guided by the two goals of
preserving the free status of all derivatives of our free software and of
promoting the sharing and reuse of software generally. </p>

<p  >&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
NO WARRANTY</p>

<p  >&nbsp;
15. BECAUSE THE LIBRARY IS LICENSED FREE OF CHARGE, THERE IS NO WARRANTY FOR
THE LIBRARY, TO THE EXTENT PERMITTED BY APPLICABLE LAW. EXCEPT WHEN OTHERWISE
STATED IN WRITING THE COPYRIGHT HOLDERS AND/OR OTHER PARTIES PROVIDE THE
LIBRARY &quot;AS IS&quot; WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY KIND, EITHER EXPRESSED OR IMPLIED,
INCLUDING, BUT NOT LIMITED TO, THE IMPLIED WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY AND
FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE.  THE ENTIRE RISK AS TO THE QUALITY AND
PERFORMANCE OF THE LIBRARY IS WITH YOU.  SHOULD THE LIBRARY PROVE
DEFECTIVE, YOU ASSUME THE COST OF ALL NECESSARY SERVICING, REPAIR OR
CORRECTION. </p>

<p  >&nbsp;
16. IN NO EVENT UNLESS REQUIRED BY APPLICABLE LAW OR AGREED TO IN WRITING WILL
ANY COPYRIGHT HOLDER, OR ANY OTHER PARTY WHO MAY MODIFY AND/OR REDISTRIBUTE THE
LIBRARY AS PERMITTED ABOVE, BE LIABLE TO YOU FOR DAMAGES, INCLUDING ANY
GENERAL, SPECIAL, INCIDENTAL OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES ARISING OUT OF THE USE OR
INABILITY TO USE THE LIBRARY (INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO LOSS OF DATA OR DATA
BEING RENDERED INACCURATE OR LOSSES SUSTAINED BY YOU OR THIRD PARTIES OR A
FAILURE OF THE LIBRARY TO OPERATE WITH ANY OTHER SOFTWARE), EVEN IF SUCH HOLDER
OR OTHER PARTY HAS BEEN ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES.</p>

<p  >&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
END OF TERMS AND CONDITIONS</p>

<p  >&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
How to Apply These Terms to Your New Libraries</p>

<p  >&nbsp;
If you develop a new library, and you want it to be of the greatest possible
use to the public, we recommend making it free software that everyone can
redistribute and change.  You can do so by permitting redistribution under
these terms (or, alternatively, under the terms of theordinary General Public
License).</p>

<p  >&nbsp;
To apply these terms, attach the following notices to the library.  It is
safest to attach them to the start of each source file to most effectively
convey the exclusion of warranty; and each file should have at least the
&quot;copyright&quot; line and a pointer to where the full notice is found. </p>

<p  >&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
&lt;one line to give the library's name and a brief idea of what it does.&gt;</p>

<p  >&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
Copyright (c) &lt;year&gt;&nbsp; &lt;name of author&gt;</p>



<p  >&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
This library is free software; you can redistribute it and/or modify it under
the terms of the GNU Lesser General Public License as published by the Free
Software Foundation; either&nbsp; version 2.1 of the License, or (at your
option) any later version.</p>

<p  >&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
This library is distributed in the hope that it will be useful, but WITHOUT ANY
WARRANTY; without even the implied warranty of&nbsp; MERCHANTABILITY or FITNESS
FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE.  See the GNU&nbsp; Lesser General Public License
for more details.</p>

<p  >&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
You should have received a copy of the GNU Lesser General Public License along
with this library; if not, write to the Free Software Foundation, Inc.,  59
 Temple Place, Suite 330, Boston, MA&nbsp; 02111-1307&nbsp; USA</p>

<p  >Also
add information on how to contact you by electronic and paper mail. You should
also get your employer (if you work as a programmer) or your school, if any, to
sign a &quot;copyright disclaimer&quot; for the library, if necessary. 
Here is a sample; alter the names:&nbsp;</p>

<p  ><br>
<b>3. Distribution Obligations.</b> </p>

<p   ><b>3.1.
Application of License.</b> <br>
The Modifications which You create or to which You contribute are governed by
the terms of this License, including without limitation Section <b>2.2</b>. The
Source Code version of Covered Code may be distributed only under the terms of
this License or a future version of this License released under Section <b>6.1</b>,
and You must include a copy of this License with every copy of the Source Code
You distribute. You may not offer or impose any terms on any Source Code
version that alters or restricts the applicable version of this License or the
recipients' rights hereunder. However, You may include an additional document
offering the additional rights described in Section <b>3.5</b>. </p>

<p   ><b>3.2.
Availability of Source Code.</b> <br>
Any Modification which You create or to which You contribute must be made
available in Source Code form under the terms of this License either on the same
media as an Executable version or via an accepted Electronic Distribution
Mechanism to anyone to whom you made an Executable version available; and if
made available via Electronic Distribution Mechanism, must remain available for
at least twelve (12) months after the date it initially became available, or at
least six (6) months after a subsequent version of that particular Modification
has been made available to such recipients. You are responsible for ensuring
that the Source Code version remains available even if the Electronic
Distribution Mechanism is maintained by a third party. </p>

<p   ><b>3.3.
Description of Modifications.</b> <br>
You must cause all Covered Code to which You contribute to contain a file
documenting the changes You made to create that Covered Code and the date of
any change. You must include a prominent statement that the Modification is
derived, directly or indirectly, from Original Code provided by the Initial
Developer and including the name of the Initial Developer in (a) the Source
Code, and (b) in any notice in an Executable version or related documentation
in which You describe the origin or ownership of the Covered Code. </p>

<p   ><b>3.4.
Intellectual Property Matters</b></p>

<p></p><p><b>(a)
Third Party Claims</b>. <br>
If Contributor has knowledge that a license under a third party's intellectual
property rights is required to exercise the rights granted by such Contributor
under Sections 2.1 or 2.2, Contributor must include a text file with the Source
Code distribution titled &quot;LEGAL'' which describes the claim and the party
making the claim in sufficient detail that a recipient will know whom to
contact. If Contributor obtains such knowledge after the Modification is made
available as described in Section 3.2, Contributor shall promptly modify the
LEGAL file in all copies Contributor makes available thereafter and shall take
other steps (such as notifying appropriate mailing lists or newsgroups)
reasonably calculated to inform those who received the Covered Code that new
knowledge has been obtained. </p>

<p></p><p><b>(b)
Contributor APIs</b>. <br>
If Contributor's Modifications include an application programming interface and
Contributor has knowledge of patent licenses which are reasonably necessary to
implement that API, Contributor must also include this information in the LEGAL
file. </p>

<p   ><b>
(c)&nbsp;
Representations.</b></p>

<p></p><p>Contributor
represents that, except as disclosed pursuant to Section 3.4(a) above,
Contributor believes that Contributor's Modifications are Contributor's
original creation(s) and/or Contributor has sufficient rights to grant the
rights conveyed by this License.</p>

<p   ><br>
<b>3.5. Required Notices.</b> <br>
You must duplicate the notice in <b>Exhibit A</b> in each file of the Source
Code. If it is not possible to put such notice in a particular Source Code file
due to its structure, then You must include such notice in a location (such as
a relevant directory) where a user would be likely to look for such a notice.
If You created one or more Modification(s) You may add your name as a
Contributor to the notice described in <b>Exhibit A</b>. You must also
duplicate this License in any documentation for the Source Code where You
describe recipients' rights or ownership rights relating to Covered Code. You
may choose to offer, and to charge a fee for, warranty, support, indemnity or
liability obligations to one or more recipients of Covered Code. However, You
may do so only on Your own behalf, and not on behalf of the Initial Developer
or any Contributor. You must make it absolutely clear than any such warranty,
support, indemnity or liability obligation is offered by You alone, and You hereby
agree to indemnify the Initial Developer and every Contributor for any
liability incurred by the Initial Developer or such Contributor as a result of
warranty, support, indemnity or liability terms You offer. </p>

<p   ><b>3.6.
Distribution of Executable Versions.</b> <br>
You may distribute Covered Code in Executable form only if the requirements of
Section <b>3.1-3.5</b> have been met for that Covered Code, and if You include
a notice stating that the Source Code version of the Covered Code is available
under the terms of this License, including a description of how and where You
have fulfilled the obligations of Section <b>3.2</b>. The notice must be
conspicuously included in any notice in an Executable version, related
documentation or collateral in which You describe recipients' rights relating
to the Covered Code. You may distribute the Executable version of Covered Code
or ownership rights under a license of Your choice, which may contain terms
different from this License, provided that You are in compliance with the terms
of this License and that the license for the Executable version does not
attempt to limit or alter the recipient's rights in the Source Code version
from the rights set forth in this License. If You distribute the Executable
version under a different license You must make it absolutely clear that any
terms which differ from this License are offered by You alone, not by the
Initial Developer or any Contributor. You hereby agree to indemnify the Initial
Developer and every Contributor for any liability incurred by the Initial
Developer or such Contributor as a result of any such terms You offer. </p>

<p   ><b>3.7.
Larger Works.</b> <br>
You may create a Larger Work by combining Covered Code with other code not
governed by the terms of this License and distribute the Larger Work as a
single product. In such a case, You must make sure the requirements of this
License are fulfilled for the Covered Code.</p>

<p  ><b>4.
Inability to Comply Due to Statute or Regulation.</b></p>

<p   >If
it is impossible for You to comply with any of the terms of this License with respect
to some or all of the Covered Code due to statute, judicial order, or
regulation then You must: (a) comply with the terms of this License to the
maximum extent possible; and (b) describe the limitations and the code they
affect. Such description must be included in the LEGAL file described in
Section <b>3.4</b> and must be included with all distributions of the Source
Code. Except to the extent prohibited by statute or regulation, such
description must be sufficiently detailed for a recipient of ordinary skill to
be able to understand it.</p>

<p  ><b>5.
Application of this License.</b></p>

<p   >This
License applies to code to which the Initial Developer has attached the notice
in <b>Exhibit A</b> and to related Covered Code.</p>

<p  ><b>6.
Versions of the License.</b></p>

<p   ><b>6.1.
New Versions</b>. <br>
Netscape Communications Corporation (''Netscape'') may publish revised and/or
new versions of the License from time to time. Each version will be given a
distinguishing version number. </p>

<p   ><b>6.2.
Effect of New Versions</b>. <br>
Once Covered Code has been published under a particular version of the License,
You may always continue to use it under the terms of that version. You may also
choose to use such Covered Code under the terms of any subsequent version of
the License published by Netscape. No one other than Netscape has the right to
modify the terms applicable to Covered Code created under this License. </p>

<p   ><b>6.3.
Derivative Works</b>. <br>
If You create or use a modified version of this License (which you may only do
in order to apply it to code which is not already Covered Code governed by this
License), You must (a) rename Your license so that the phrases ''Mozilla'',
''MOZILLAPL'', ''MOZPL'', ''Netscape'', &quot;MPL&quot;, ''NPL'' or any
confusingly similar phrase do not appear in your license (except to note that
your license differs from this License) and (b) otherwise make it clear that
Your version of the license contains terms which differ from the Mozilla Public
License and Netscape Public License. (Filling in the name of the Initial
Developer, Original Code or Contributor in the notice described in <b>Exhibit A</b>
shall not of themselves be deemed to be modifications of this License.)</p>

<p  ><b>7.
DISCLAIMER OF WARRANTY.</b></p>

<p   >COVERED
CODE IS PROVIDED UNDER THIS LICENSE ON AN &quot;AS IS'' BASIS, WITHOUT WARRANTY
OF ANY KIND, EITHER EXPRESSED OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING, WITHOUT LIMITATION,
WARRANTIES THAT THE COVERED CODE IS FREE OF DEFECTS, MERCHANTABLE, FIT FOR A
PARTICULAR PURPOSE OR NON-INFRINGING. THE ENTIRE RISK AS TO THE QUALITY AND
PERFORMANCE OF THE COVERED CODE IS WITH YOU. SHOULD ANY COVERED CODE PROVE
DEFECTIVE IN ANY RESPECT, YOU (NOT THE INITIAL DEVELOPER OR ANY OTHER
CONTRIBUTOR) ASSUME THE COST OF ANY NECESSARY SERVICING, REPAIR OR CORRECTION.
THIS DISCLAIMER OF WARRANTY CONSTITUTES AN ESSENTIAL PART OF THIS LICENSE. NO
USE OF ANY COVERED CODE IS AUTHORIZED HEREUNDER EXCEPT UNDER THIS DISCLAIMER.</p>

<p  ><b>8.
TERMINATION.</b></p>

<p   ><b>8.1.
</b>This License and the rights granted
hereunder will terminate automatically if You fail to comply with terms herein
and fail to cure such breach within 30 days of becoming aware of the breach.
All sublicenses to the Covered Code which are properly granted shall survive
any termination of this License. Provisions which, by their nature, must remain
in effect beyond the termination of this License shall survive. </p>

<p   ><b>8.2.
</b>If You initiate litigation by asserting a
patent infringement claim (excluding declatory judgment actions) against
Initial Developer or a Contributor (the Initial Developer or Contributor
against whom You file such action is referred to as &quot;Participant&quot;)
alleging that: </p>

<p   ><b>(a)
</b>such Participant's Contributor Version
directly or indirectly infringes any patent, then any and all rights granted by
such Participant to You under Sections 2.1 and/or 2.2 of this License shall,
upon 60 days notice from Participant terminate prospectively, unless if within
60 days after receipt of notice You either: (i) agree in writing to pay
Participant a mutually agreeable reasonable royalty for Your past and future
use of Modifications made by such Participant, or (ii) withdraw Your litigation
claim with respect to the Contributor Version against such Participant. If
within 60 days of notice, a reasonable royalty and payment arrangement are not
mutually agreed upon in writing by the parties or the litigation claim is not
withdrawn, the rights granted by Participant to You under Sections 2.1 and/or
2.2 automatically terminate at the expiration of the 60 day notice period
specified above. </p>

<p   ><b>(b)</b>
any software, hardware, or device, other than such Participant's Contributor
Version, directly or indirectly infringes any patent, then any rights granted
to You by such Participant under Sections 2.1(b) and 2.2(b) are revoked
effective as of the date You first made, used, sold, distributed, or had made,
Modifications made by that Participant. </p>

<p   ><b>8.3.
</b>If You assert a patent infringement claim
against Participant alleging that such Participant's Contributor Version
directly or indirectly infringes any patent where such claim is resolved (such
as by license or settlement) prior to the initiation of patent infringement
litigation, then the reasonable value of the licenses granted by such
Participant under Sections 2.1 or 2.2 shall be taken into account in
determining the amount or value of any payment or license. </p>

<p   ><b>8.4.</b> In
the event of termination under Sections 8.1 or 8.2 above, all end user license
agreements (excluding distributors and resellers) which have been validly
granted by You or any distributor hereunder prior to termination shall survive
termination.</p>

<p  ><b>9.
LIMITATION OF LIABILITY.</b></p>

<p   >UNDER
NO CIRCUMSTANCES AND UNDER NO LEGAL THEORY, WHETHER TORT (INCLUDING
NEGLIGENCE), CONTRACT, OR OTHERWISE, SHALL YOU, THE INITIAL DEVELOPER, ANY
OTHER CONTRIBUTOR, OR ANY DISTRIBUTOR OF COVERED CODE, OR ANY SUPPLIER OF ANY
OF SUCH PARTIES, BE LIABLE TO ANY PERSON FOR ANY INDIRECT, SPECIAL, INCIDENTAL,
OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES OF ANY CHARACTER INCLUDING, WITHOUT LIMITATION,
DAMAGES FOR LOSS OF GOODWILL, WORK STOPPAGE, COMPUTER FAILURE OR MALFUNCTION,
OR ANY AND ALL OTHER COMMERCIAL DAMAGES OR LOSSES, EVEN IF SUCH PARTY SHALL
HAVE BEEN INFORMED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES. THIS LIMITATION OF
LIABILITY SHALL NOT APPLY TO LIABILITY FOR DEATH OR PERSONAL INJURY RESULTING
FROM SUCH PARTY'S NEGLIGENCE TO THE EXTENT APPLICABLE LAW PROHIBITS SUCH
LIMITATION. SOME JURISDICTIONS DO NOT ALLOW THE EXCLUSION OR LIMITATION OF
INCIDENTAL OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES, SO THIS EXCLUSION AND LIMITATION MAY NOT
APPLY TO YOU.</p>

<p  ><b>10.
U.S. GOVERNMENT END USERS.</b></p>

<p   >The
Covered Code is a ''commercial item,'' as that term is defined in 48 C.F.R.
2.101 (Oct. 1995), consisting of ''commercial computer software'' and
''commercial computer software documentation,'' as such terms are used in 48
C.F.R. 12.212 (Sept. 1995). Consistent with 48 C.F.R. 12.212 and 48 C.F.R.
227.7202-1 through 227.7202-4 (June 1995), all U.S. Government End Users
acquire Covered Code with only those rights set forth herein.</p>

<p  ><b>11.
MISCELLANEOUS.</b></p>

<p   >This
License represents the complete agreement concerning subject matter hereof. If
any provision of this License is held to be unenforceable, such provision shall
be reformed only to the extent necessary to make it enforceable. This License
shall be governed by California law provisions (except to the extent applicable
law, if any, provides otherwise), excluding its conflict-of-law provisions.
With respect to disputes in which at least one party is a citizen of, or an
entity chartered or registered to do business in the United States of America,
any litigation relating to this License shall be subject to the jurisdiction of
the Federal Courts of the Northern District of California, with venue lying in
Santa Clara County, California, with the losing party responsible for costs,
including without limitation, court costs and reasonable attorneys' fees and
expenses. The application of the United Nations Convention on Contracts for the
International Sale of Goods is expressly excluded. Any law or regulation which
provides that the language of a contract shall be construed against the drafter
shall not apply to this License.</p>

<p  ><b>12.
RESPONSIBILITY FOR CLAIMS.</b></p>

<p   >As
between Initial Developer and the Contributors, each party is responsible for
claims and damages arising, directly or indirectly, out of its utilization of
rights under this License and You agree to work with Initial Developer and
Contributors to distribute such responsibility on an equitable basis. Nothing
herein is intended or shall be deemed to constitute any admission of liability.</p>

<p  ><b>13.
MULTIPLE-LICENSED CODE.</b></p>

<p   >Initial
Developer may designate portions of the Covered Code as &quot;Multiple-Licensed&quot;.
&quot;Multiple-Licensed&quot; means that the Initial Developer permits you to utilize
portions of the Covered Code under Your choice of the MPL or the alternative
licenses, if any, specified by the Initial Developer in the file described in
Exhibit A.</p>
